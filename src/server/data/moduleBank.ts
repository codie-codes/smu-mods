    description:
      "The purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of statistics through illustrative use of statistical methods for solving applied problems. Emphasis will be placed on statistical reasoning, rather than derivation of theoretical details. Students will learn to solve common statistical problems using statistical software. This course is designed for students who wish to pursue a non-quantitative major at SMU. Students who intend to pursue a quantitative major should take its companion course, COR-STAT1203 Introduction to Statistical Theory.",

It draws upon concepts from mathematics and computer science – more precisely, discrete mathematics, data structures and algorithm design. This course will hone students’ analytical skills as they are challenged to think abstractly and computationally. Their minds will be open to the wonders of computing, as they go behind the scene to unravel the fundamental analytics that empower Google, consulting agencies and service companies. NOTE: To facilitate learning in this course, you are required to know and use programming. You are advised to pick up the Python programming language before the course, for instance by practising with online tutorials such as http://learnpython.org. By taking this course, students will: • discover the science of computing • model problems and learn practical problem-solving techniques to tackle complex computational problems (beyond what a spreadsheet is capable of solving) • apply problem-solving techniques to develop more elegant and efficient programs • learn to write programs to represent and manipulate with complex data objects • understand the challenge of scale, not only in dealing with large data sets, but also in appreciating the nature of computing and computability",

    description:
      "You give reasons for what you do and think every day. You argue. You often argue about things that matter to you. For example you might argue that you are the best candidate for promotion, about whether your company should invest in China, about the best way to help a friend or about what the right thing to do is in an ethical dilemma. The list is up to you. Increasingly in the 21st job market, you will need to think straight about any issue, even those unfamiliar to you. Recent surveys indicate that the most important skills employers are looking for are critical thinking and problem solving skills. We will teach you how to get better at reasoning and arguing in a way that can be applied to any subject matter.\n                Topics covered include evaluating arguments, constructing arguments, reconstructing arguments, formalizing arguments, clarifying meaning and identifying common mistakes in argument (fallacies). At the end of the course you should be able to (1) identify the structures of real-life arguments in order to decide if they are good or bad, and (2) argue logically about things that matter to you. This course is specifically designed to improve writing, thinking and oral presentation skills that are applicable to all areas of academic study and relevant to working life. Careful application in this course will deepen your capacity to critically evaluate everyday practical scenarios and will help you ‘think outside the box’.",

    description:
      "\n            The dynamic and fast changing nature of our world today is best described by VUCA, a term coined by the US Army War College. VUCA stands for Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous. The Arab Spring saw a change of government in countries like Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. Once powerful countries in Europe are now fighting bankruptcy. The growth of the developing world which was taken for granted has begun to slow down. Even companies that were synonymous with their product categories just a few years ago are now no longer in existence. Kodak, the inventor of the digital camera had to wind up its operations, Borders, once the second largest US bookstore, has shut down due to their inability to evolve their business models with the changing times.\n\n            With such momentous changes happening in the world today, this course prepares the students to better understand the complexity and difficulties in reacting to the ambiguity inherent in those changes. This course helps students to understand the tensions in a given situation and how they need to think through a problem from multiple dimensions.\n\n            The course aims to give students an insight into the mega trends and forces that are impacting their world. We ask what are some of the causes of these trends and their business implications? What can future managers like themselves do about understanding these changing trends, and why they need to address, appreciate, adapt and attempt to manage these changes in their ecosystem? The course aims to introduce some basic VUCA concepts, in order to broaden their world view of management and nature of managing complex problems. The first half of the course introduces some of these trends, while the second half provides tools and possible frameworks to deal with the VUCA aspects that they will face in the future.",

The primary theoretical perspective taken is the stakeholder view of the firm which allows for close examination of apparently conflicting goals between different stakeholders' interests. Related frameworks and applications discussed in this course include corporate social responsibility, globalization, corporate governance, and public policy measures affecting business. The frameworks and issues discussed are critical to understanding how firms can be both financially successful and valuable to society, a concern which is increasingly influencing managerial decision-making. Illustrations and applications to the Singapore context as a small open economy will be discussed.",

    description:
      "Data Science has become one of the main drivers in transforming businesses and organizations. With proper data collection, preparation, analysis and modelling, insights can be achieved leading to better decision making and actions that create positive impact. Data analytics is divided into different levels namely, descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics and automated (or embedded) analytics. In this course, students will acquire practical skills in modelling and analysis to resolve business problems using software tools including Excel and Tableau. Knowing how to effectively use these tools to build models and analyse data to solve problems will add tremendous value in our students’ future professional career. This course’s primary focus is on using Excel spreadsheet as a platform to build mathematical models from scratch to represent business problems for detailed analysis. The use of such models to drive understanding and consensus towards generating insights and actions enhanced the assurance of execution success. With the data collected, data manipulation and transformation will be needed to prepare the data into useful forms for analysis. In terms of data analytics, this course will cover descriptive analytics, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics, using both Excel and Tableau. In-class exercises would be used to present business problem modeling and analysis. Students would interactively develop the skills and experience to deal with open-ended questions, unclear assumptions and incomplete information. In addition to the individual assessments (take-home assignments and in-class quizzes), a group project will allow students to apply the knowledge and skills acquired to solve a business problem of their choice end-to-end where they will define the business questions, collect the necessary data, build the models, perform the data analytics, to draw insights and conclusions.",

      "\n            The overall objective of this module is to build and develop students' competency in leadership and teamwork skills. The course employs both a theoretical and an experiential learning approach with the aim of fulfilling the objectives as outlined below.\n\n            Students will gain knowledge and skills about leadership development and team-building skills based on theories, principles, concepts, application, exercises/class activities, self-assessments/instruments, and experiential learning.\n\n            Central to the course is the action-based and experiential Group Project Assignment that offers an opportunity for students to work in groups to collaborate with a non-profit organization or profit-based organization that upholds community development and/or corporate social responsibility or sustainability initiatives1, that is, they initiate and act as idea champions to contribute to community with a project of their own and approach beneficiaries along the way to amend or improve on their ideas. Students are also free to work with any profit and/or non-profit organization on an existing or new project they may have, provided such opportunities exist and are offered to students.\n\n            As idea champions, students work in groups, to develop/invent a prototype/model or mobile application or put into place a process, program or plan such as a business plan that will value-add and contribute to the needs of the beneficiary or organization of their choice. It is entirely up to the leadership of the organization concerned whether they would consider implementing or not implementing what students have designed. In other words, there is no compulsion for any organization to eventually sponsor the proposed ideas to the organization(s) concerned or may be collaborating with.\n\n            The outcomes of the group project for students are outlined as follows:\n            (i) Students will learn about leadership from the leaders they are connecting with. For example, they will learn how and why today's leaders are engaged in community-based or social initiatives in Singapore and beyond.\n            (ii) Students will also learn from the leaders lessons on leadership and/or teamwork based on the leaders' experiences.\n            (iii) By undertaking a hands-on group project, students will also learn practical lessons as well as the complexities of teamwork based on their OWN experience and process of working internally, with their group mates and externally, with organizations outside of school.\n            (iv) Each student will also reflect on his/her own learning throughout the project from start to end as outlined below (see 'Reflection Essay' for details).\n            (v) Students will also fulfill other learning objectives that include cognitive and academic development as outlined below in the section, 'Learning Objectives'",

    description:
      "The core objective of the new SMU-X Transformative Leadership course is to nurture a new generation of young leaders motivated and capable of tackling intricate global and local challenges related to the nexus of ‘digital disruption, demographic change and diversity’ in an integrated, interdisciplinary fashion, providing the opportunity to integrate perceived differences between older and younger people in terms of values, communication priorities; age discrimination or the initiation of new types of social (‘digital’) behaviours transmitted from the plugged-in ‘Generation Z’ (born 1996 and after) to Baby Boomers (born 1946 to 1964). These three challenges (positioned at the interface of both current and future issues) are not only globally relevant but also have significant local implications for Singapore. Embedded in the experiential SMU-X initiative, the Transformative Leadership course provides students with a unique learning opportunity to develop and implement (socially) innovative solutions to make a positive impact on business and society in close collaboration with reputable partners in business, nonprofits and government. Learners will be paired up with an external SMU-X partner to work on relevant innovative projects with real impact. The successful completion of such transformative SMU-X projects requires learners diving deep(er) into various disciplines such as social sciences, business, political governance, public policy, demography, technology, etc. It is expected that the chosen practical challenges commissioned by SMU-X partners will ‘stretch’ students, forcing them to step out of their comfort zones and to explore the unknowns in order to make a ‘real’ difference ‘out there’ in both the social and business sectors. In terms of effective leader development, in particular, transformative leadership, the SMU-X course design will support learners in expanding their individual capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes. Emphasis will be put on proximal indicators of leader development such as self-views around self-concept, including leader self-awareness, leadership self-efficacy and leader. Through their SMU-X projects, students will appreciate the importance of leadership development so that they can articulate what it takes for teams and their leaders to create strong(er) alignment and high(er) levels of commitment. The latter requires interpersonal trust, care and concern as well as shared mind-sets regarding (transformative) goals and values such as the ‘real’ sharing propelled by collaborative leadership approaches.",

It also provides participants with simulated negotiation experiences that allow them to develop their negotiating skills, and to understand how the conceptual and analytical tools can be used in practice.",

Actors from public, private, and non-profit sectors collectively engage in policy decision-making to address complex social problems. Today's policy problems are described as ‘wicked problems’ that lack a set of clear definitions, causes and effects, and solutions. The wicked nature of the policy problems requires considering the perspectives of multiple stakeholders and innovative policy solutions. This course explores how governments and their stakeholders have experimented with new ideas, policies, governing processes, institutional arrangements, management tools, and technologies, to create public value and effect positive change. Using cases studies from a variety of policy areas and different countries, the course encourages students to understand the opportunities and challenges of public sector change initiatives including collaborative governance, e-governance, and coproduction. It prepares students to effectively address the multifaceted challenges of public policy and management through a variety of scholarly and practitioner publications, interactive and reflective exercises, and class discussions.",

"Can Machines think ?” This class takes one of the central questions addressed to and by the proponents of the AI, artists, and philosophers as an entry point to consider the current emphasis on the transformative potential of machine learning from a historical perspective. Therefore, the course structure is mostly chronological. We will situate the field of AI in the long tradition of automata construction, as well as in the context of a cold war meta-discipline of cybernetics. We will read the original works of the founders of the field, such as Alan Turing and John McCarthy, to reconstruct the main lines of the intellectual development of the field as well as its paradoxes. We will also overview some of the main philosophical and ethical debates around the notions of “intelligence," “rationality," and “mind” in light of the computational technics for decision making. Finally, the course materials include a selection of science fiction novels, films, and short stories in order to discuss the notion of technological imagination as a link connecting public science, cultural production, and the formation of a scientific/engineering research programs.',

      "This course is a response to the increasing use of robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and digital technologies in business and society. Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War I when the US army experimented with unmanned aerial torpedos. Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations. Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various functionalities of robotics, UAVs and digital innovations in order to critically assess these technologies and to articulate informed opinions about ‘the good’, ‘the bad’, and ‘the future’ of these novel technological developments. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors plus exposure to tech entrepreneurs and digital (corporate) innovation champions.",

With the explosion of data available to governments and companies, and cloud computing platforms making supercomputing power widely available, science fiction and reality have never been closer. However, the true capabilities and limitations of AI are often poorly understood, as some predict doom, while others promise the moon. Modern AI techniques have the capacity to improve the way organisations operate, improving decision-making and increasing human and environmental wellbeing, but also carry the potential to cause harm if used irresponsibly or ignorantly. Accessible to technical and non-technical students alike, this course will introduce you to key techniques, showing how they can be flexibly applied to a range of problems, from using game theory to intercept wildlife poachers, through machine learning models for crime prediction, to risk-aware logistics scheduling. The course will guide you through the ethical implications of AI, considering the effects of biased data and the uncritical application of techniques.

The central question that we will investigate concerns the reciprocal influences between the nation, its institutional manifestations and ‘the people’. How do ‘the people’ shape institutions and fashion a nation on a daily basis and vice versa?\n\n                To explore these relationships, the course is structured around three themes: prerequisites, process and practice. The first theme provides the general conceptual framework through a series of brief discussions of what a nation is, how it relates to a state and to a ‘people’. The second theme is devoted to what is often seen as the quintessential nation-building moment: the formal drafting of a constitution. We will consider the choice of language in that text to harness the people’s fidelity to the budding nation as well as the respective roles played by the elites and ordinary citizens during the constitution-process. For the third theme, we will probe the lived reality of how the nation constitutes itself every day through its people, from the elites who claim to speak on behalf of the nation in formal rule-making to the personification of the nation in image, song and icon to the architectural design of state institutions and public spaces and the wearing of folk costumes or traditional outfits that seek to give expression to the identity of the nation.\n\n                Our explorations will feature the experiences of a diverse range of nations located within and outside Asia. These will provide the backdrop against which the Singapore story will be considered, thereby allowing students to interrogate the familiar domestic narrative of nation-building from a comparative angle. The approach taken will be practically grounded and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from law, political theory, history, linguistics, architecture and the arts.

Speaking and listening ability is developed through oral exercises, individual reports, class discussions, songs and videos.\n\n                    This course will also explore the cultural hurdles to understanding the French and sketch the context that forms “Frenchness”. Through the introduction to traditions, customs and daily life of the French, students will be given the opportunity to understand French behaviour and culture.\n\n                    The lessons will be conducted both in French and in English.",

      "Globalization is the increasing interconnectedness of social, economic, and political activities between countries around the world. In this course, we will examine the sociology of globalization from these and other various perspectives, paying attention to specific topics that have become prominent in global debates. We will cover major theoretical perspectives that social scientists of different disciplines have used to guide their study of globalization. Although globalization often seems like a set of chaotic events, these theoretical perspectives shed light on the systematic and institutionalized nature of global processes. We will discuss issues in global politics, society, and culture where we will examine the role of the nation-state, global human rights, social movements, and questions of national culture and identity. We will also explore issues in the global economy and questions of global economic governance, where will examine the consequences of global institutions and economic globalization. Throughout the course, we emphasize the core question of global governance.\n\n        This course prepares students for informed citizenship in a rapidly globalizing world. Many students will go on to find employment in organizations in which decisions made can have profound global consequences. As such, students will be equipped with the necessary conceptual and empirical knowledge to evaluate debates on globalization and to critique the roles that state and non-state actors play in global processes. Students will be trained to discern the positive and negative impacts of key actors that are involved in global governance. Students will also acquire familiarity with key sociology, political science, and economics approaches to globalization.",

This is mostly due to their limited knowledge and understanding of China, even if they can speak Chinese. This course aims to address this problem by enhancing the students’ understating of the unique history, culture, economy, politics and law in China. To help the students understand the nuances of doing business in/with China, interesting cases and events will be used to illustrate how things work in China in real life. With the knowledge acquired in the course, the students will gain a better understanding of how business is conducted in China; the interaction between business on the one hand, and culture, politics and law on the other hand; as well as how foreign firms may survive and prosper in China.",

    description:
      "Law and legal systems are ubiquitous in modern societies. As Kant noted, law takes away man’s “savage (lawless) freedom” to return to him a more limited freedom under the law. But what exactly is law? How is law related to justice? Is law merely a power phenomenon? Is law merely politics? Is the monopolization of coercive force by the state justified?\n\n                This course provides students with the opportunity to think about law’s nature and its role in society. We will examine these questions through accounts of law offered by legal positivists and natural law theorists, and challenges posed by alternative critical accounts of American legal realism and critical legal studies. How do modern and critical accounts of law shape our thinking about the nature and purpose of law? Are the accounts rooted in particular historical contexts or cultures, or are they as relevant today or within our society? How does adopting a particular account of law impact the present practice of law? Do the accounts have something to say about how we, as lawyers or citizenry, can harness law’s potential as a tool for transforming society?\n\n                Through this course, students will have a unique opportunity to engage their hearts and minds in relation to the concepts of law and justice. Students will also be encouraged to relate the theories studied to current contexts. The course's focus is on critique of ideas and not mere description of doctrine. The methods of assessment will be intentionally geared towards facilitating critical thought. This course encourages students to formulate their own theses about law and justice, and meaningfully understand the role they can play – as lawyers and as citizens – in the legal process.",

    description:
      "Humans have been making war and peace throughout their recorded history. We can be fairly certain this was the case well before civilization emerged. Conflicts always seem to erupt over scarce resources, contentious values and ideas, fissures in relationships, fault-lines in societies, the list goes on. And, intertwined with these conflicts are efforts to end violence, to heal wounds and reconcile, to share resources, to create or re-establish a semblance of harmony between peoples. Most of all will perceive these human activities as binary opposites, as mutually exclusive, leading us to invest particular meanings in each to distinguish them further from each other. Indeed, thanks to influences from culture, media, from our communities, families and leaders, we typically perceive war and peace as suffering versus happiness, action not stillness, a zone of masculine combat versus one of safety for women and children, and much more. These ingrained perceptions shape our decisions, actions and relationships in fundamental ways, determining our behavior and experiences in all spaces and times, whether we have construed them to be in the context of war, peace, and anything beyond or in-between. Since our views of war and peace are so fundamental to our life experience, this course asks us for a deeper engagement of our prior knowledge.\n                    Through critical engagement with a variety of disciplines and empirical contexts, we will consider the intertwined phenomena of war and peace in theory and praxis. The course explores the value systems we attach to each, why, and with what consequences for ourselves and others? We investigate how our notions of war and peace contribute directly to the construction of our identity as well as ideas about belonging, power, justice, progress, and more. In so doing, we look into the ways people, their customs, laws and culture respond to their perceptions and experiences of war and peace; reflect on how they debate the purposes of war-making and peace-making; and discuss how they compete and cooperate for the spoils of both war and peace. Also, we will study how our knowledge of war and peace may continually change over time. By the end of the course, students will have an expansive understanding of how these two phenomena come together in ways that structure and define their everyday lives.",

    description:
      "In this course, we introduce students to the economic way of thinking about societal issues. We use the themes of incentives and empiricism to illustrate the power of simple economic ideas, and their ability to explain, predict, and improve what happens in the world. The course will examine how market activities are shaped by both the private and public sector. It will allow students to appreciate how free markets and government policies affect society, creating winners and losers, and to understand the societal trade-offs implicated in an economy. The course will also examine debates on the importance of social institutions in contributing to economic growth, and on economic policies surrounding the world financial crisis. Two topics related to Growth in Asia will be covered in the course.",

Big Questions will introduce students to the challenging ethical, theoretical, and operational debates that attend to these themes. Students in any given year will be able to choose from a menu of sub-themes, each using a different disciplinary lens and focusing on different aspects of the theme, while also sharing a canon of readings and attending public lectures dedicated to the year's theme for a shared intellectual experience. The themes may include Happiness and Suffering, Global and Local, Robots and Humans, Wealth and Poverty, War and Peace, amongst others.",

      "The objective of the Course is to raise the awareness of students with regard to the multi-faceted ethical and social responsibility issues faced by businesses and corporate executives, whether individuals or organisations. The initial part of the Course will focus on critiquing various ethical and social theories developed by philosophers, economists, sociologists, management theorists and others. Both Western and non-Western theories will be examined. The Course also aims at developing the moral reasoning skills of students and applying them to the specific problems and dilemmas faced by individuals and organisations in the business and corporate world.",

      "We begin our adventure by exploring the essential elements of Computing Systems — hardware, software, and network technologies — through a series of challenging yet fun learning activities. We grow our coding skills by building a networked, distributed computing system: starting with physical computing devices that unite the cyber and physical realms, we add fundamental networking capabilities for devices to exchange information and form networks, and finally integrate the system into the cloud. Equipped with newfound skills and knowledge, we unleash our creative energies, our youthful idealism, and our capacity to dream, by designing visionary technology to conquer a real-world societal challenge. This is a journey into the unknown. Yet, a still, small voice deep within us compels us: Courage! Do not be afraid! Put out into the deepest oceans and brave the stormiest seas! Let down your nets for an awesome catch! The adventure reaches its peak at the project showcase, where we witness the work of human hands come to fruition, leaving us inspired to reflect deeply and broadly about how we, as global citizens, can harness the power of Computing Systems as a potent force in the service of humanity.",

This course is designed to equip students with the knowledge and skill to develop well-styled database-driven web applications. In the early weeks of the course, students would be introduced to web concepts and trained to build static web pages using HTML. Next, students will be taught on how to program dynamic web applications using PHP. Programming concepts that students have learned in Introduction to Programming (IS111) will be revisited (using PHP as the programming language), expanded, and used to allow students to program web applications that can adapt based on user inputs. After basic PHP programming has been introduced, students will then be taught on how they can connect to a database to store, retrieve, modify, and delete data. They can then design dynamic web pages that present different contents reflecting contents stored in a database as well as allow users to modify database contents through the webpages. In the final weeks of the course, students will be introduced to more advanced PHP concepts including session management to allow for stateful interactive information exchange between users and a web application.",

Combining with the skills learnt in IS113 course, which focuses on developing database-driven web applications with basic web designs, after this course, the students will be equipped with full stack web development skills, who can build both front-end and back-end software. In the introductory weeks of the course, the students will revisit HTML and server-side programming (PHP) concepts learnt in IS113. Then, the students will learn the concept of “Styling” the web pages. The students will learn a style sheet language called cascading style sheets (CSS) and learn how to separate the content and presentation of web pages, how to control web page layout, colors and fonts, how to bring multiple styles into a web page, how to control the layout of multiple web pages efficiently, etc. Next, the students will learn the concept of adding responsive behaviors to web pages to enhance the user experience. The students will learn a client-side programming language called JavaScript to make ordinary web elements like input boxes, buttons, forms, tables, menus interactive and animated. Furthermore, they will learn how to connect to API gateways and process data from external sources like RESTful web services so that they can build practical applications. In the latter weeks of the course, the students will be introduced to programming with frameworks. The students will learn how to use frameworks to build complex web applications in an efficient, scalable manner. More specifically, the students will be introduced to Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework for developing responsive website and introduced to Vue, a progressive JavaScript framework for building rich user interfaces.",

It provides strong and reliable support for all kinds of information systems in various industries. It also greatly reduces the go-to-market time for high-tech start-up companies. Although many people are using cloud in their daily work, but few of them have structural understanding on how cloud functions. With more and more fancy features incorporated in Cloud, it seems difficult for beginners to understand their relations and apply them to real world problems. This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concept and basic structure of cloud computing. The topics covered include basic cloud concept, typical business and technical requirements on cloud infrastructure, basic building blocks for an cloud solution, and how to manage reliability and incident using cloud tools. All topics are designed based on actual commercial usage pattern to support real business requirements. Computing theory and mathematical analysis are included at a minimally needed level. Exercising and integration of knowledge learnt will be covered through assignments, labs, and a demonstrative project for real world problems. After this course, students are expected to gain a structural concept of how cloud operates and how to manipulate cloud resources to support information system and business needs. The principles and techniques learnt in this course will help students understand the common core structure of various commercial cloud platforms and how to go deeper to a specific function. With this foundation, students can easily build up their knowledge of a chosen commercial cloud on a systematic way using online resources.",

Sustainability in cities, particularly in the context of environmental and climate change.\n\n                2. The role of technology in enhancing and disrupting “normal” ways of life in the city, through the use of shared riding/food delivery apps, and social media.\n\n                3. How technology applied judiciously can enhance livability and livelihoods for a wide range of urban residents who are both technology-savvy and residents uncomfortable using technology.\n\n                \n                Students will gain an understanding of how selected industries consider and apply these technologies towards urban sustainability issues. While there will be some in-class meetings to discuss theoretical concepts, learning will be primarily experiential in nature through class discussion, group exercises, and a team project. Guest speakers with practical and industrial experience may be invited as well. The course project will work with one or two industry sponsors. Students are expected to conceive a solution to address a defined problem statement, related to an aspect of urban sustainability with societal impact, and in accordance to the real-world needs of the industry sponsor.",

Project selections do not need to be unique, meaning multiple teams can select the same project idea. Each student project team will be assigned to a sponsor and an SMU faculty supervisor.  Sponsors will provide project scope and management for student teams to have practical industry learning experiences.  Student teams will have weekly check in meetings, either virtually or physically, with their sponsor. Student project teams will be expected to develop a working software application prototype, to be delivered to the sponsor at the end of the course.  Sponsors will specify the technologies to be used, including; development tools/languages, OS, database, 3rd party libraries, target deployment environment e.g. cloud environment.

Students will learn: The different paradigms of algorithm design such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. The analysis on the complexity of algorithms. Limits of algorithm design via the study of intractability including the reductions of given problems to known problems and the knowledge of NP completeness and NP hardness. More modern algorithm design concepts such as approximation to achieve more effective problem solving and more efficient solutions. This course will go into the theoretical underpinnings of efficiency, algorithm correctness, and how algorithm design has a basis in identifying mathematical properties of the problem.",

      "With the advancement of systems like GPT, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are anticipated to significantly impact various aspects of individuals' lives. While these AI techniques have demonstrated remarkable, occasionally superhuman, performance across numerous applications, there is a growing concern regarding their safety and security. It has been shown AI systems are subject to a range of attacks, ranging from adversarial attacks (i.e., perturbing an input slightly causes an AI to make completely wrong predictions), backdoor attacks (i.e., backdoors can be easily embedded in neural networks), and privacy-violating attacks such as membership inference attacks (i.e., an adversary may reliably infer whether a certain sample is used during training or not). In addition, AI systems can inherit or amplify biases present in their training data, potentially leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Furthermore, many AI models, including GPT, are complex and not easily interpretable. It makes understanding how these models make decisions highly nontrivial, even though it is crucial for trust and accountability. This course aims to present a systematic view on the range of AI safety problems that have been identified, analyse their root causes, and study potential approaches to mitigate the safety and security risks. In particular, we will focus on answering two key questions. First, given an AI system, how do we systematically evaluate its safety risk? Second, given an AI system that potentially has safety issues, how do we systematically mitigate the risks? This course will feature real-life AI safety issues on popular AI systems such as ImageNet, GPT and so on.",

Thus, the course will require not only the understanding and development of some theoretical results with mathematical rigour, but also hands-on programming skills for practical applications. Knowledge in basic calculus is required. Some concepts in discrete mathematics (CS104) are useful, such as counting, sets and functions. While the course will use Python and its packages to illustrate and practice class work, prior knowledge of Python is not required. However, previous experience in any programming language such as C/C++ and Java is expected.  Good programming etiquettes such as code readability, reusability, efficiency and reproducibility are also expected at a level adequate for most computer science courses.",

      "Machine Learning is one of the fundamental subjects in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience (e.g., learning to recognize images, classify text documents, detect fraudulent credit card transactions, or drive autonomous vehicles). This course covers both fundamental principles and practical algorithms for machine learning. It includes in-depth introduction of the techniques and algorithms in two major machine learning paradigms – supervised learning and unsupervised learning. For supervised learning, it covers both linear and non-linear models for two supervised tasks: classification and regression. For unsupervised learning, it covers three major unsupervised tasks: clustering, dimension reduction, and anomaly detection. The course also includes deep learning approaches for each of the aforementioned five tasks, highlighting the principles of making different “shallow” models “deeper”.\n      The course is intended to prepare students for a good understanding of principles, challenges, and opportunities in ML. It aims to equip students with the capability of applying machine learning techniques to address real-world applications and building the foundations of doing research in machine learning. To this end, the course highlights the following five key features:\n      ·   \tSystematic treatment of ML techniques. It covers shallow and deep algorithms and techniques for five popular ML tasks.\n      ·   \tUnderstanding of commonly used mathematical foundations in ML. The course introduces principled mathematical foundations behind diverse ML techniques, such as least squares optimization, Lp regularization, maximum likelihood estimation, gradient descent optimization, and backpropagation.\n      ·   \tIntroduction to emerging topics and current ML challenges. The course includes an overview of emerging topics including semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and interpretability, security, privacy, and safety in ML.\n      ·   \tProgressive ML model development. CS421 includes a Kaggle-competition-style group project to shape the capability of developing effective models to address a real problem with data progressively made available.\n      ·   \tModel implementation. One assignment and diverse lab sessions are designed to support the development of capability in implementing different ML models using existing libraries.\n      It is a course recommended for those who have some ML experience/skill and want to achieve a more systematic and comprehensive understanding of ML, as well as for beginners who are not familiar with ML but have very strong curiosity to explore. Extensive coding is expected for this course.\n      Students are strongly encouraged to have proficiency in IS103 Computational Thinking prior to reading this course.\n      NOTE: While this is an introduction course, it is a technical course and it is highly recommended that students are proficient in programming, probability, statistics and linear algebra (e.g., CS103 Linear Algebra for Computing Applications, CS105 Statistical Thinking for Data Science, CS201 Data Structures and Algorithms and CS202 Design and Analysis of Algorithms).\n      Previous course code & title: IS449 Introduction to Machine Learning\n      ",

      "Search and optimization are the fundamental building blocks of AI. Almost all problems in AI (including machine learning) involve some sort of search or optimization. This course will cover the basics of search and optimization. Broadly, the course will be split along two axes: one is discrete vs continuous optimization, and another is heuristic methods vs exact techniques. The applications of the topics covered in class is immediate, for example, shortest path problems are used by all mapping services such as Google Maps. Travelling salesman problems are used to design routes for parcel delivery. Fundamental topics such linear and convex programming with gradient descent will help in understanding techniques in deep learning which will be useful for other AI courses. Recent applications of linear programs such as in designing security of critical infrastructure will be discussed in class.",

Image perception is the task of getting computers to see in a human like manner. To achieve this, researchers have pooled techniques and results from a large variety of different fields. This course introduces the mathematical tools and concepts underlying image perception. These include deep learning, linear algebra, statistics and multi-view geometry. The goal is to get students comfortable with utilizing and interpreting the results of state-of-art machine learning techniques. At the end of the course, students should be aware of what can be achieved by current visual perception techniques, how to achieve it and what the limitations of these techniques are. Students are expected to have a good mathematical foundation and programing skills. Foundational Mathematical Courses (i.e., CS103 or CS105) will be an advantage but are not insisted on. The primary programing language of the course is python. Having a good GPU at home will help with course work. Previously titled as CS424 Image Perception.",

Cyber threat intelligence empowers cyber defenders on countering those flexible and persistent threats with a good understanding of the attacker's behaviour, motivation and playbook. During an attack, an organization needs a top-notch and cutting-edge threat hunting or incident response team armed with the threat intelligence necessary to understand how adversaries operate and to counter the threat.

In its aftermath, there is a greater appreciation of the need to proactively build resilient and high-quality health systems, and to explore new innovations. With a rapidly ageing population, the burden of disease will increase even as the pool of potential care providers decreases. At the same time, the cost of healthcare needs to be contained, while meeting patient needs and keeping providers motivated. This calls for radical increases in the productivity of the healthcare sector. In this scenario, there is a need to understand complex systems concepts in assessing the impact of interventions. This technology-agnostic course will explore the context of the healthcare industry, with a particular focus on Singapore and Asia. Students will understand and apply the concepts of systems thinking and gain hands-on experience in both qualitative and quantitative simulation of health systems through the techniques of system dynamics, discrete event simulation, and agent-based modelling. The course will utilise cases and educational games, but also encourage students to build system simulation models. It will help students to broaden their horizons and develop critical thinking, while gaining practical skills in simulation and understanding the concepts of Digital Twins in social systems.",

Governments, e-commerce websites, even short video platforms, are now relying on big data technologies to gain business insight and design their strategies. Different from the traditional data analytics industry, the infrastructure of big data is mostly built on top of cheap commodity PCs and open source software.  This trend has successfully lowered the deployment as well as operational cost of such big data platforms. On the other hand, it raises new challenges to data engineers and scientists when building their own system with such infrastructure. This course aims to bridge the gap between the big data practice and the skills of undergraduate students in data infrastructure. It will provide an overview of big data infrastructure, which enables the student to build their own system based on the data characteristics and processing demands. It will get the students involved in the whole process of big data system building, i.e., the design, planning and implementation. It will also cover additional tools and techniques crucial to the success of big data, including data visualization, and monitoring. Students are expected to learn skills of 1) software development infrastructure in mainstream data-driven IT products; 2) data crawling and extraction frameworks for web-based data collection; 3) data storage architecture for highly variant data in big data systems; 4) massive data processing frameworks; 5) real-time and streaming data processing frameworks; 6) data visualization tools for big data analytics; 7) orchestration of the open source systems with high-level data interface.",

It includes a range of topics, from supervised learning (such as Naïve Bayes Classifier, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks) and their applications, to unsupervised learning (such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)) and their applications, and from traditional (shallow) learning (such as Support Vector Machine (SVM)) to recent state-of-the-art deep learning methods (such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). The course is intended to prepare students for basic understanding of machine learning fundamentals and equip students with the capability to apply machine learning techniques through real world business applications (to solve real world problems). NOTE: This is an algorithm and technical course with applications. It is highly recommended that students are proficient in programming, and have learnt probabilities and statistics. Solid math background, such as linear algebra and calculus, will be very useful and helpful for your learning journey as well.

      'In a world where digital technologies are not just tools but extensions of our daily lives, their societal impacts are far-reaching yet still emerging. Past slogans like "move fast and break things" led tech companies to overlook harms, as evidenced by scandals involving user data misuse and workplace culture issues.\nThere is now broader recognition that responsible innovation requires understanding potential risks and aligning with human values. But how can we ensure that technology advances in a manner that\'s ethical, sustainable, and beneficial for all?\nThis timely course explores ethics in computing. Through case studies and frameworks, students will develop skills in critical and nuanced thinking about complex issues at the intersection of technology and society.\nWhat you will find in this course:\nEmbracing Complexity: We won\'t seek single "right" answers. Instead, we\'ll foster a space for exploring multidimensional problems with interconnected tradeoffs, encouraging students to understand, appreciate, and engage with differing viewpoints.\nSkill Development: Students will practise not just theory but systematic analysis of real-world impacts, preparing them for the consequential decisions they may face in their future careers.\nStructured Exploration: The course is divided into two engaging parts. The first introduces fundamental concepts, while the second dives into contemporary dilemmas, exposing the tensions between responsible development and disruptive innovation.\nRespectful Discourse: A commitment to respectful dialogue is central to this course. We recognise the intricate and "messy" nature of real-world problems, with ramifications extending far into a dynamic and uncertain technological future.\nDistinct Focus on Technology: While courses like "COR3301 Ethics and Social Responsibility" provide a broad understanding of ethical conduct across various professions, this course specialises in the intersection of technology and ethics. This course targets the unique challenges of the digital age, equipping tech professionals with the nuanced understanding needed to navigate ethical dilemmas specific to computing, AI, and digital human rights. It\'s a tailored exploration for those aiming to align technological advancements with responsible decision-making.\nEmpowering Future Leaders: By attuning students to ethical imperatives and responsible decision-making processes, this course prepares the next generation of tech professionals to navigate and guide technological progress in a manner that honours human values and serves the greater good.\n',

Next, we interrogate how Asian nationalists and creative practitioners sought to move beyond these Orientalist tropes by adapting Shakespeare's plays to create bold, new intercultural performances. We then dive into a range of canonical Asian texts and their contemporary adaptations. We ask what these texts can tell us about the connected political, cultural and technological histories of Asia and Europe; probe how these texts play shape our perceptions of racial, religious, national and gender differences; and ponder the place Singapore writers have in world literature today.",

We will primarily draw on the fields of environmental studies, anthropology, cultural studies, history, geography, and sociology to critically examine the multifaceted dimensions of the Anthropocene in the region. In this course, we will explore contemporary debates around climate change, capitalism, biodiversity, and political and cultural ecology to understand the complex and interrelated challenges posed by these issues. In doing so, it will challenge us to rethink what it means to live, be, and thrive in the Anthropocene Asia. This course invites students to go beyond disciplinary paradigms and consider how emerging issues in the Anthropocene demand new ways of thinking, learning, and acting.

      "Home to around forty percent of the world's population, Asia is a region of extraordinary natural, cultural, economic, and socio-political diversity. It is characterised by both patterns of continuity across time and space, as well as far-reaching and rapid social and physical change. This course surveys a variety of contemporary trends and challenges found across Asia. By exploring weekly themes such as urbanisation, transnational migration, civil society and social movements, religious politics, security issues, environmental degradation, geopolitics and the role of China, economic growth and disparity, and regional structures like ASEAN and SAARC, students will gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of contemporary Asian societies. At some points in this course we will approach 'Asia' with a wide-lens, taking global, transnational, and regional perspectives, while at other times we will zoom in to particular experiences at a national or sub-national level. This is a survey course, and while students will be exposed to a wide range of issues relevant to contemporary Asia, they will also be encouraged to delve deeper into one or two select topics that are of particular interest to them.",

It examines forms of 'difference' such as ethnicity, religion and sexuality, and policy frameworks are important for multicultural societies. The course critically engages with the debates within scholarship of multiculturalism that encourages a theoretically-informed approach towards a range of empirical examples from Europe, North America and Asia. The analysis of empirical examples enables the consideration of demographic, cultural and ideological particularities, as well as nation-building efforts that vary across historical and geographical environments. This context-driven approach will also be taken towards the analysis of contemporary policy issues including citizenship, education and employment, including current debates such as disability in education and the 'headscarf affair'. The course also includes an applied component which allows students to put the theories to use and to experience how to deal with diversity through three dialogue sessions outside the campus.",

The EU and ASEAN are among the world's most advanced regional structures, representing distinct models of integration. Since the 1980s, the evolution of EU-ASEAN relations has offered valuable insights into the multifaceted concept of interregionalism in international law and relations. ASEAN became a priority in the EU's Asia policy agenda following the Treaty of Lisbon, and the European Commission's 2015 “Trade for All” strategy articulated an ASEAN approach based on individual agreements, culminating in a region-to-region framework. The recent conclusion of the EU's trade and investment agreements with Singapore and Vietnam reinforces this incremental approach towards realising the EU-ASEAN free trade agreement. Amidst China's changing status, the impasse in WTO negotiations, and the COVID-19 pandemic, EU-ASEAN legal frameworks and relations have gained prominence on the global stage. In 2020, the two blocs upgraded their “Dialogue Partnership” to a “Strategic Partnership,” which aimed at enhancing economic and security cooperation, sustainable connectivity, and development. In 2021, the EU's Indo-Pacific strategy underscored its engagement with the ASEAN-led regional architecture, particularly in light of the economic and political impact of the CPTPP and RCEP. In this SMU-X course, students will explore EU and ASEAN institutions and examine the EU's new Indo-Pacific strategy from legal and political perspectives. The course will specifically evaluate EU-ASEAN economic agreements and focus on cutting-edge areas such as trade and investment liberalisation, AI and digital trade, and sustainable development. Students will gain practical experience by collaborating with legal and policy experts to tackle real-world challenges. Please note: This course does not include an overseas trip and does not meet SMU's global exposure requirement. However, students will visit EU and/or ASEAN institutions in Singapore and engage in projects with legal and policy experts specialising in EU-ASEAN law and relations. The course will also incorporate SMU's blended learning approach, which may include some online sessions. The grade will be on a pass/fail basis.",

All big cities in both First and Third World countries as well as emerging markets such as New York, London, Tokyo, Paris, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Dehli, Jakarta etc. have to cope with high population density and serious challenges such as air pollution or traffic congestion. How do we pack more people into big cities and yet continue to achieve a high quality of life? How do we create and manage 'good cities' which are safe, spacious, green, connected, fair and resilient? How can cities create economic wealth while still fulfilling the CSR responsibilities of sustaining a “Green Planet”? What are the best practice designs and technical smart city solutions which could be leveraged to tackle these challenges and how can they be successfully commercialised? This course will provide answers to these questions with special emphasis on the managerial and commercial aspects of smart city concepts.\n\nThe key lies in creating and effectively managing innovative and sustainable, smart cities able to leverage on new technologies such as smart grids or sensor networks to create a place where people can live, play and work well. Starting from the stakeholder requirements of citizens and planners of innovative cities, the course will introduce students to urban design concepts as well as commercialization, management challenges and implementation issues of the smart city model. There will also be a focus on how good governance and enabling technologies such as sensor networks can facilitate the creation, management and sustainability of 'good' cities.\n\nWith the help of case studies and resource persons such as industry leaders, innovative city designers, tech experts and business development experts from local and int. companies such as ST Electronics, JTC, Jurong Consultants, Frost & Sullivan, IDA International, Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) etc., students will be familiarized with the opportunities and challenges of the 'smart city business' which represents a key element in the value creation and extraction strategy of the Singapore Government and related businesses.",

As A.I. technology is already surpassing human decision-making in certain instances, there is growing concern about 'uncontrolled A.I.' in business and society, incl. regulatory and ethical-legal challenges. Against this background, this new course aims to equip students with foundational, theoretical and practical knowledge about A.I. driven business applications in selected private and public sector organizations. Besides reconstructing the history of artificial intelligence from the 1960s to the current era (as well as a refresher about the basics of computer science algorithms such as audio and video compression algorithms), we will put emphasis on explaining the A.I. driven business models of several top international and local organizations. In order to appreciate the power of A.I. technology, we will take a closer look 'under the A.I. hood' to understand what makes machine learning, deep learning, neural networks and image analysis tick. Visits to A.I. powered business organizations engaged in customer service management, finance, marketing, supply chain management or manufacturing will be organised aimed at appreciating both the benefits and downside of A.I. Students graduating from this course will be equipped with critical competencies to solve real-world business problems using A.I. technology while simultaneously casting a critical eye on the morality and ethics of commercialising A.I.",

      "Our world is characterized by the phenomena of VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity) and overload (of attention, information, stimulation, and work). This affects our attention, emotions, cognitions, well-being, functioning, and performance. It challenges our ability to flourish, to both feel well and do well. In this course, we explore the science and practice of mindfulness as a way of flourishing at work and in life. Mindfulness-based practices are rooted in Eastern contemplative traditions but have been adapted to a secular, modern context. A large amount of research has accumulated, showing that such mindfulness-based practices confer numerous benefits both for well-being and functioning, including at the workplace. “Mindfulness at work” has two meanings in this course: First, we will focus on mindfulness in the context of work and organizations. Second, we will incorporate mindfulness practices such as mindfulness meditations into the course itself. Thus, in this course, we will examine both the science as well as the practice of mindfulness. For the science aspect, we will read and discuss scientific research studies on mindfulness related to each of the course topics. For the practice aspect, we will engage in mindfulness practices based on established and carefully designed secular mindfulness trainings. The practice aspect is integral to this course and students will be required to commit about 20-45 minutes daily to these practices. Evidence suggests that the practices can help individuals feel and function better and are a good investment of the students' time.",

The course begins by reviewing the impact of colonialism and historical trajectories on contemporary politics. We then move to a focus on the specific eleven countries in the region, tracing key political events, outlining the impact of leaders, reviewing the patterns of political contestation and providing a foundation of the structure of governments. In the final part of the course we focus on specific issues and challenges, including the role of leaders, dynamics within political institutions, development, civil society, conflict and human rights, ASEAN, foreign policy and regional security. This course provides a valuable foundation for understanding Southeast Asia and is recommended for any student interested in learning about the region.",

Governments worldwide are tasked with navigating this complexity, requiring an evolved approach to policy-making and the incorporation of diverse forms of evidence. This course adopts an interdisciplinary, practitioner-focused perspective, exploring the diverse landscape of evidence and its role in innovative policy-making. Through an examination of case studies from various policy areas and different countries, we delve into how governments and public organizations use multiple types of evidence, from traditional statistical data to intuition and experiential insights, to formulate impactful policies. Our exploration encompasses both technical tools like Python and Tableau, as well as thought frameworks like scenario thinking and futures thinking, providing a holistic view of the evidence-policy nexus. We will investigate the role of different stakeholders in the policy-making process, emphasizing the concept of co-creation within the Singapore context.",

      "Subjective well-being (SWB) refers to individuals' evaluations and experiences of the quality of their lives in terms of how they think and feel, so it involves both cognitions and emotions. At the general level, we can construe SWB as the relative presence of positives and absence of negatives. However, what are these positives and negatives, how do they combine and inter-relate, and why and how do they matter? The psychological study of subjective well-being attempts to address these questions using an evidence-based approach grounded in the scientific method and the empirical research on the constructs, causes, correlates, and consequences of SWB. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the scientific literature and psychological study of SWB. Although the primary focus is on SWB at the individual level due to the inherently subjective nature of the construct, we will also discuss issues and implications in the contexts and levels beyond the individual such as the team, organizational or national levels.",

      "Singapore is a fascinating subject of sociological inquiry. Constructing Singapore's history remains a struggle against competing notions of the state as a tool of British colonialism, an adjunct of Malaysia before its untimely expulsion, immigrants' lay-over and Lee Kuan Yew's political success. Since independence, Singapore's leaders lament its lacking natural resources to justify their “pragmatic” management of the everyday lives of Singaporeans, including speech, educational environment, sexuality, religious expressions, ethnic identity and political culture, at the expense of citizens' rights. Populated dominantly by ethnic Chinese with Malays and Indians as minorities, yet geographically surrounded by Muslim-majority nations have made the ruling PAP reluctant to observe multiracialism in governance policies which compromises the nation-building project. Presently, forces of globalisation threaten the state's monopoly over political space and ideologies. This module targets students interested in developing a critical appreciation of the socio-economic and political contexts that structure Singaporeans' daily lives. It highlights critical historical circumstances that shape Singapore's post-independent governance policies, political discourses and contemporary development as a nation-state. It sharpens students' sociological imagination as they deconstruct political ideologies to grasp alternative interpretations of the development of Singapore society and make sense of contemporary issues of importance in Singapore and to Singaporeans.",

      "The past 20 years have seen several epidemics and pandemics: 2003 SARS, 2009 Flu Pandemic, the continuing Ebola outbreaks since 2014, and now, COVID-19. Discussions about preparedness for an outbreak abound and systems of biological research, biomedical interventions, and global health measures are implemented to contain and resolve an outbreak. Governments and communities respond by suspending some privileges as scientists and institutions fast-track therapeutic solutions. While these events may feel “unprecedented,” epidemics have occurred in the past. The key is to understand what has changed and what has remained similar. This course examines epidemics from the perspectives of history of biomedicine, global health, and the life sciences. Understanding the history of epidemics will help us attain a comprehensive understanding about what epidemics actually are. This knowledge will also aid in our social responses to COVID-19 in our everyday lives, chart informed biomedical interventions and potential socio-political actions. We will explore questions such as, How have epidemics shaped society? How did the biomedical practices around epidemics arise? Are vaccines really the “magic bullet” to solve all of our problems?",

First, a professional matter which involves machine learning or the Blockchain. Second, you will work with a lawyer! This course gives you a toolkit, a shorthand for constructive dialogue with a lawyer's concerns, to solve your problems within your domain expertise. Consider this example: what is your understanding of a “token”? A banker might think about asset ownership records, and link a “token” to “accounts”. To a programmer, a “token” could be a technical standard for a fungible unit of value on the Blockchain. In contrast, a lawyer understands a “token” based on legislation or judge-made law. Significantly, lawyers have an exclusive right to advocate for all your professional interests in a court of law. This course will cover legal reactions to technological innovations in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We will examine case studies in Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain concerning, for instance, autonomous vehicles and smart contracts, which are dumb contracts. Lawyers are trained to shape these realities with words by manipulating natural language. You will understand how – and why - lawyers convert the realities of algorithms and codes into legalese to mitigate harm against persons, to aid commercial growth and resolve its disputes.",

Volatility in financial and physical markets, the failure of systemically important financial intermediaries, global climate and health crises, shifting social expectations and corporate governance concerns can directly or indirectly impair the financial, manufactured, natural, human, intellectual and social capitals of corporations. The ability to recognize, measure, manage and communicate such risks becomes critical to the long-term sustainability of corporations.\nThis course examines recognition, measurement, reporting and disclosure requirements for corporations in relation to financial and non-financial risks under the frameworks of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and other related bodies. Concepts, principles, and applications—with respect to market, counterparty, and sustainability risks—will be discussed from the perspectives of different stakeholders. While the focus of the course will be primarily on accounting and financial reporting, an integrated approach will be adopted.",

      "Traditionally, the accounting function's role is always viewed as that of a steward, the control centre for the organisation, rather than the catalyst for enterprise growth. The term 'back office' is often used to describe the operating nature of accounting function. So in today's volatile global business environment, the key challenge for accounting function is how to lead the enterprise in its growth strategies while ensuring effective risk management and stewardship of the enterprise. With complexity and data proliferation, increasingly the CEO and the board turn to accountants to help make sense of all the data, to help cut through this complexity, and to provide more informed analysis on the business and its operation. The opportunity for accounting function is if it can generate the insights that help make better corporate decision making, while continuing to ensure effective control of the enterprise, its reputation as a catalyst for growth will be guaranteed. To do so, traditional accounting departments may have to transform themselves into 'intelligent accounting functions'. Intelligent accounting functions run their operations as cost effectively as possible, leveraging technology to reduce finance operating costs; strengthen stewardship and control so as to establish a solid foundation to support growth. The biggest challenges, however, lie in creating the efficiencies needed to gather and process basic financial data and continue to deliver traditional finance outputs while at the same time redeploying their limited resources to enable higher-value business decision support activities. This accounting analytics practicum which adopts SMU-X approach, focuses on a few key topics that are vital to establishing an intelligent accounting function (refer to the diagram below): finance strategy and transformation, lean finance and finance shared services, business intelligence analytics, and enterprise process management. In this experiential learning course, students from various disciplines learn what comprises a highly optimised accounting process, design an end-to-end process management and explore the underlying accounting IT systems and advanced data analytical applications. By working closely with instructors from accounting and information systems disciplines, together with an industry partner, students are expected to carry out design and development of an intelligent accounting function solution. The whole idea is to engage students in real-life application and to encourage students to creatively apply concepts to practical problems in their pursuit of solving real-world problems. Students will apply the concepts in real projects.",

The course equips students with the knowledge of how to engage the Tier 1 mainstream media (otherwise known as earned media) drawing on Pang's (2010) Mediating the Media model. It also equips students on how to complement this with the organization's owned and shared media. As leaders of the future, regardless of which industry you are in, it is important to understand how the Tier 1 media work. It is a useful course for students of all disciplines - in your roles as domain experts in the respective fields, consultants, organizational leaders or communication professionals as you would need to engage the media. It also prepares you for work in all sectors - be it corporate, public, not-for-profit, or for those who want to work in overseas markets.",

When addressing such questions in organizational settings, communications managers often rely on what they know from executive experience and/or conventional wisdom, executing a number of communication strategies aiming at having a desired impact. This course will show how strategies that may hold intuitive appeal can be challenged and better informed by psychological principles underlying human judgment and decision-making. Students will learn the key psychological principles about how people process information in a given context and how to assess the conditions under which intended and/or unintended consequences arise.

This course introduces students to the essentials of effective IR and covers the various methods that publicly-listed companies can employ to successfully communicate with the global investment community, including institutional investors, retail investors, analysts, financial media, financial bloggers and regulators. The course will look into the development of a company's investor communication strategy and investment narrative. Groups of students will role-play as Investor Relations practitioners to plan, develop and execute investor relations communications for a company through its life cycle. Three real-world scenarios will be introduced to provide students with insights into how a company can respond to an investor relations crisis, a merger & acquisition transaction, and a change in corporate strategy. Groups will work through the investor communications for these scenarios with the objective of developing appropriate narratives to secure buy-in from the financial community and protect the reputation and valuation of the company. Students will also examine the digital and mainstream building blocks of IR tools, which are integral parts of a sound IR programme, and understand how data analytics can be used to enhance shareholder identification and targeting. As part of the course, students will also develop a 12-month investor communications programme to engage IR stakeholders.",

Spatial data are commonly used in regional science and urban economics (related to property prices, crime, household income, etc.), epidemiology and public health (such as disease clusters, etc.), environmental science (air pollution, ozone density, etc.), ecology, biology, geology and other disciplines.\n\nWe start by looking at the practical aspects of organising and visualising spatial data where we will discuss methods available to organise and visualise (i) vector data and (ii) raster data using the R programming language. These are the two main ways in which spatial data are maintained. We also discuss how to use a coordinate reference system to give spatial awareness to a dataset and make meaningful maps including animated and interactive maps using OpenStreetMap and others.\n\nWe then consider the statistical aspects behind spatial data analysis with a special focus on how to re-align classical statistical methods towards spatial data. An outline is given to the three broad types of spatial data in spatial statistical analysis: (i) geostatistical data, (ii) areal data and (iii) point patterns. Standard spatial regression techniques are used to build models to explain attributes that are spatially correlated such as the number of COVID cases. These techniques are fully implemented using R throughout the course. You may follow the links to get a flavour of the applications in this course.",

In particular, we will discuss model specification, diagnostics, multicollinearity, serial correlation, heteroskedastictiy, quantitative and qualitative variables, and cross-sectional and time series data modeling. A practical orientation will be adopted focusing on identification of appropriate techniques, execution of analysis, and sound interpretation of results. Concepts will be discussed via examples and illustrations with datasets using the software EViews on the computer. (This is a hands-on course so everyone must have a laptop in class).",

First, it is to introduce students to modern macroeconomic theory, in particular formal macroeconomic models built on micro-foundations. Second, it is to develop a deep understanding of macroeconomic phenomena such as business cycles, long-term economic growth, and the process of economic development, as well as macroeconomic policy issues, such as the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on the economy and the design of a social security system or an unemployment insurance scheme.\n\nThis first part of the sequence first covers the topic of measurement of macroeconomic variables, before easing students into micro-founded macroeconomics by developing a static general equilibrium model with production and using it to analyze a number of fiscal policy issues. The course then moves on to a dynamic framework and covers the mechanics of long-term economic growth and the role of policy in economic development. Students are then introduced to dynamic decision problems when considering consumption and savings decisions of households and investment decisions of firms, and these building blocks are combined with a Walrasian approach to the labor market to complete the development of a dynamic macroeconomic model, which is then used to consider fiscal policy questions like the role of the timing in taxes and government expenditures. The course ends with an in-depth analysis of the data and mechanics of long-term economic growth and the role of policy in economic development.",

The neo-classical growth model will be introduced as a framework for\nunderstanding how growth occurs. The course will then unpack the model part\nby part, both theoretically and empirically, for a more nuanced understanding\nof growth. Its ingredients such as human capital formation will be studied. Its\nassumption of perfect institutions will be examined with a particular focus on\nproperty rights, corruption, and financial development. The causal impact of\ninstitutions on growth will be explored. Finally growth theory will be revisited\nto see how poverty traps arise as a result of imperfect institutions leading to\nemergence and persistence of poor economic outcomes. The course will end\nwith an introduction to political economy of development where we will explore\nreasons why inefficient policies are often chosen.",

The beginning of the course will focus on what determines house price movements (captured by house price indices) and the role of real estate cycles (including bubbles) in mortgage default. The course will then be devoted to analyzing mortgage instruments used to finance investments in real estate. This includes calculations of payment streams for different types of mortgages, consideration of different types of mortgage contracts that shift interest rate and default risk between lenders and borrowers, and the role of the secondary market for mortgage securities. The last portion of the course will be devoted to evaluating pricing and risk in commercial real estate markets (REIT structures). Equipped with aforementioned skills, this course helps students to develop an eye towards the role of housing and mortgage markets in the recent financial crisis as highlighted in the United States and potential policy implications for the local market.\n",

Other topics covered include behaviors of key players (physicians, hospitals, pharmaceuticals) in the health care sector, the role of government in the provision of health care, and issues in health care system reform. Finally, this course discusses health policy debates in developing countries. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to evaluate current health care policy issues from an economic perspective.",

First, it is to introduce students to modern macroeconomic theory, in particular formal macroeconomic models built on microfoundations. Second, it is to develop a deep understanding of macroeconomic phenomena such as business cycles, long-term economic growth, and the process of economic development, as well as macroeconomic policy issues, such as the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on the economy and the design of a social security system or an unemployment insurance scheme. This second part of the sequence first reviews the topics of consumption and savings, investment, and the labor market covered in ECON 112 (Macroeconomics 1) and enriches the analysis by considering the impact on consumption and investment decisions of (a) imperfections of the financial sector, for instance leading to the existence of credit constraints, (b) uncertainty, and (c) adjustment costs, as well as by introducing the flow approach to the labor market and using the search and matching framework to understand labor market data and policies. The course then introduces the notion of money and considers the role of financial intermediaries, which are then used to study the long-term impact of monetary policy as well as the role of banking supervision and macro-prudential regulation. The course finally studies business cycles and covers the measurement of cycles, reviews the main existing theories and their policy prescriptions, with a particular emphasis being put on severe recessions or depressions.",

The first portion of the course lays a foundation for equity valuation by discussing in detail equity return concepts and factors driving firm performance. Then, we cover discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, which derives the price of equity as the discounted value of future cash flows. In addition, the course describes relative valuation methods, which uses appropriate characteristics (such as the price-to-earnings ratio) to identify over-valued and under-valued stocks. Besides traditional approaches, this course also discusses how unstructured data such as news can be associated with stock valuation.",

The approach will be based on the economics and finance of entrepreneurial firms and financial intermediation – tracking the corporate life cycle and concomitant financing pathways available to an entrepreneur at various stages from start-up to growth, IPO, and finally cashing out via LBO. This 'Corporate Life Cycle' approach provides a critical building block for those interested in how Private Equity works. The course has an analytical nature, not an institutional nor a descriptive one. Students will learn how to understand rigorous theoretical arguments, perform simple valuation modelling techniques, analyse and evaluate practical frameworks in order to formulate or make critical decisions and recommendations, through case study discussions and group exercises. The course will require both individual and teamwork. Individual work will be necessary to prepare for class discussions, assigned readings and case studies required for the exam. Teamwork in the valuation exercise and case studies will lead students to a unique opportunity to experience the discussion and management of complex, real-world problems.",

      "The objective of this course is to introduce wealth management and advisory needs/focuses across client segments spanning from the mass-affluent space to the private high net-worth individual (HNWI) space. Wealth management is to grow, preserve, and transfer wealth to future generations. The traditional focus in investment management has primarily been on institutions. However, with the large growth in private wealth globally and particularly in Asia, wealth management for HNWIs is fast emerging. The course begins with a macro view on the wealth management landscape before advancing to understand the similarities and differences between managing wealth for institutions versus for individuals. With individuals, we will appreciate the need for different investment products and wealth solutions across client segments based on needs and suitability. Students will learn how to risk profile a client using behavioural finance knowledge and models, prepare an investment policy statement (IPS) for a particular client's profile and be able to suggest an asset allocation based on the IPS. As the life cycle stages of a client progresses, the wealth advisory approach must incorporate retirement planning. Students will learn the iterative wealth management and advisory process where client profiling, monitoring and review of investment portfolios, implementation and executions of the investment plans are conducted regularly and dynamically across the life cycle stages of a client. Ethical behaviour builds trust. We will examine ethical conduct in the investment advisory process and the corporate governance process of banks to encourage ethical behaviour of client advisors. Last but not least, we will introduce sustainability investing as a preference in client's IPS and how to approach ESG requirements of the client.",

      "Today's businesses and investors are increasingly dealing with the risks and opportunities of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, due to the scarcity of resources, conflicts in community and labor relations, and climate change. ESG risk management is increasingly vital for companies due to several compelling reasons: 1. Reputation and Brand Value: Companies with strong ESG practices are perceived more positively by consumers, investors, and other stakeholders. Managing ESG risks helps protect and enhance a company's reputation and brand value, reducing the risk of negative publicity and boycotts. 2. Regulatory Compliance: Governments and regulatory bodies are imposing stricter ESG-related regulations. Effective ESG risk management ensures compliance with these regulations, avoiding fines, legal action, and operational disruptions. 3. Investor Demand: Investors are increasingly considering ESG factors in their investment decisions. Companies that manage ESG risks well attract more investment and often benefit from lower capital costs. ESG performance is now a key metric for many institutional investors and funds. 4. Operational Efficiency and Cost Savings: Managing environmental risks can lead to more efficient resource use, waste reduction, and energy savings. Social and governance improvements can enhance employee satisfaction and productivity, reducing turnover and associated costs. 5. Risk Mitigation: ESG risks, such as climate change impacts, social unrest, and governance failures, can have significant financial and operational impacts. Proactively managing these risks helps companies avoid or mitigate potential losses and disruptions. 6. Competitive Advantage: Companies that excel in ESG risk management often have a competitive edge. They are better positioned to anticipate and adapt to market changes, meet stakeholder expectations, and capitalize on new business opportunities related to sustainability and ethical practices. 7. Long-Term Sustainability: ESG risk management supports the long-term sustainability of a company by addressing the broader impacts of its operations on the environment, society, and its governance structure. This holistic approach ensures the company can thrive in the future while contributing positively to the world. This course will investigate how ESG risk considerations can be integrated into a company's wider Enterprise Risk Management Frameworks. Focus here will be on Environmental Risk considerations (Climate Change and Nature/Biodiversity), given the importance and regulatory focus that these attract.",

      "Climate science indicates that to keep global warming within the 1.5°C threshold above preindustrial levels, we must reduce global emissions to reach net zero by 2050. Despite growing recognition of this imperative and increasing corporate commitments to decarbonisation, most of these commitments lack detailed and credible plans. Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 will require a fundamental transformation of the global economy, particularly in the energy and hard-to-abate sectors that contribute the most to global emissions. This transition demands significant investment, estimated at US$3-4 trillion per year, necessitating substantial scaling and deployment of both private and public sector capital. This course delves into decarbonisation pathways and key climate transition strategies within the energy and hard-to-abate sectors, equipping students with the knowledge and skills to assess credible transition planning and articulate key decarbonisation challenges and growth opportunities in the emergence of new clean technologies. The course also highlights the wider policy landscape and how significant government policies can influence the development of low-carbon products and their supply chains. Additionally, it explores various funding structures to finance companies' decarbonisation strategies, the meaning of sustainable business, and the need for companies to transition in a financially sustainable manner. By the end of this course, students will understand the challenges and opportunities associated with reducing carbon emissions in traditionally difficult-to-decarbonise sectors such as cement, steel, fossil fuel energy, and transport. They will gain foundational knowledge necessary for finance professionals to assess the viability and impact of decarbonisation and climate transition strategies. Students will learn about the technical processes and commercial viability of decarbonisation technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, and alternative fuels like hydrogen, as well as geographical considerations, national circumstances, and geopolitical factors. The course will also cover the role of international cooperation, government policies, and private sector initiatives in driving decarbonisation. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to contribute to the development and implementation of effective decarbonisation strategies, fostering a low-carbon future for Asia's most challenging sectors. The course is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects of decarbonisation and climate transition strategies. This includes analysis of viable pathways to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, focusing on the energy and hard-to-abate sectors; exploration of technologies such as carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, and alternative fuels; examination of significant government policies and their impact on the development of low-carbon products and supply chains; an overview of different funding mechanisms to support decarbonisation efforts; discussion on the importance of financially sustainable transitions for businesses; and practical examples and case studies to illustrate successful decarbonisation strategies and initiatives. This course is designed to provide students with a well-rounded understanding of the critical issues and innovative solutions in the quest to reduce carbon emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy.",

The primary objective of this course is to empower students to critically engage with research findings across multiple disciplines by understanding the methods used, their strengths and limitations, and whether said methods have been used correctly. To do so, students will begin by interrogating the 'objectivity' of scientific evidence. Students will then be introduced (intuitively) to three fundamental statistical approaches: hypothesis testing, linear regression, and experimental methods. The use of these three fundamental approaches will be critiqued by examining how statistics are often done wrong and replicating existing studies. The second part of the course will highlight the interdisciplinarity of research methods and showcase the main research methods used in economics, politics, geography, and the behavioural sciences, with a focus on understanding the strengths and limitations of different research approaches and methods. The course will conclude with sessions focusing on fieldwork and research ethics.",

In this course, students will be exposed to a range of these 'modern problems', and be guided through approaches to them, drawing from insights from the fields of economics, geography, philosophy, political economy, and urban studies. By adopting a multi-perspectival approach to analysing problems, and solutions, students will be exposed to, and gain a deeper appreciation for the value of a multidisciplinary approach to problem-solving, and also have an opportunity to acquire skills to be adroit thinkers who are able to draw on multiple disciplinary traditions to inform their viewpoints and decisions..",

Different classification systems for torts will be examined: by interest, by the nature of the interference (intention, recklessness, carelessness, strict liability) and by whether consequential harm is needed (torts actionable per se). One goal will be to demonstrate the dynamic nature of law and its development to meet changing social and economic conditions. Before an examination of the various torts, the students will learn about the internal classification of torts and the relationship of the law of torts to other legal obligations.",

Several amendments have also been made to\n                  Singapore's IP legislation in order to implement the country's obligations under the\n                  United States – Singapore Free Trade Agreement (which was concluded in May 2003).\n                  More recently, the Copyright Act 1987 was repealed by Parliament and replaced by the\n                  (new) Copyright Act 2021.\n                  You will in this course be introduced to the different types of IP rights and the various\n                  branches of IP law. Some of these rights include copyright, patent and trade mark rights.\n                  We will also have the opportunity to explore, in some detail, the common law actions of\n                  passing off and breach of confidence. Obviously, a course on IP extends beyond a prosaic \n                  2\n                  examination of our domestic legal infrastructure and it is a subject that will also aid in\n                  understanding entrepreneurial development in information technology.\n                  The study of IP was, at one point, a somewhat esoteric specialisation. Today, IP occupies\n                  a central position in the global, knowledge-based economy and this course should\n                  therefore appeal to those who wish to equip themselves with knowledge of a burgeoning\n                  and highly relevant area of the law.",

The\n                  ROC was established in 1912 after overthrowing the Qing Dynasty. According to the Cairo\n                  Declaration, the ROC assumed control of Taiwan after World War II. In 1949, following its defeat\n                  in the civil war to the Chinese Communist Party, which established the People's Republic of China\n                  (PRC), the ROC government relocated to Taipei. In 1971, United Nations General Assembly\n                  Resolution 2758 transferred China's seat from the ROC to the PRC, leading to Taiwan's unique\n                  status under international law.\n                  Taiwan's legal system is based on the ROC Constitution promulgated in 1947. The ROC adopted\n                  the Chinese legal system in Taiwan, influenced by Japan during its administration. Germany and\n                  the United States have significantly influenced Taiwan's legal development in constitutional, civil,\n                  and commercial law. The Legislative Yuan (Parliament) is Taiwan's unicameral legislature. The\n                  Council of Grand Justices (Constitutional Court) of the Judicial Yuan holds the power to interpret\n                  the Constitution. The Executive Yuan serves as the executive branch, with the Premier appointed\n                  by the President, who is elected every four years by universal suffrage.\n                  Today, Taiwan ranks among the largest Asian economies and operates as a vibrant democracy\n                  under a two-party system since the lifting of Martial Law. In this course (under the Overseas\n                  Project Experience (Law in Asia) model), students will examine various aspects of Taiwanese law\n                  and explore Taiwan's legal relationships with the United States, China, and Singapore. They will\n                  gain practical experience working with lawyers and legal counsels to address real-world legal\n                  challenges.\n                  This course is supported by the Taiwan Studies Project Grant from the ROC Ministry of Education.\n                  Some sessions may be conducted online, and a one-week field trip to Taipei, Taiwan, is planned.",

      "The module has two general aims. First, to develop an understanding of two\n                  apparently competing regulatory paradigms (law, on the one hand, and technological\n                  management, on the other); and second, to consider some possible consequences of\n                  a transition from the legal regulatory paradigm to the technological management\n                  paradigm. This transition is claimed already to be in train in many common law\n                  jurisdictions - it is the direction of regulatory travel - and the technological\n                  management regulatory paradigm now seems particularly salient in light of myriad\n                  advances in computation and AI. Drawing and interrogating the contrast between the\n                  two paradigms will allow us to see and evaluate the assumptions and benefits of each\n                  as well as their disadvantages. We will examine the contrast both in general terms, in\n                  our early classes, and then in particular contexts, such as private law and the practice\n                  of adjudication, in later classes.",

In particular it will\n                  cover the main formal insolvency proceeding in Singapore for companies, ie, liquidation. In\n                  that context, the substantive policies and principles of the law will be addressed - e.g., the pari\n                  passu principle, the concept of set-off, the avoidance of suspect transactions entered in the runup to insolvency, and the liability of corporate officers. In addition, the law relating to\n                  company receivership will be addressed.\n                  Further, Singapore corporate insolvency law has increasingly focussed on the avoidance of\n                  liquidation through the restructuring of debts, ie, measures designed to help viable debtor\n                  companies prevent unnecessary liquidation. Thus, the course will also cover the formal\n                  restructuring procedures available in Singapore, ie, schemes of arrangement and judicial\n                  management.

And yet, conventionally, most\n                  law students learn about the corporate form solely through an examination of the company law in\n                  their home jurisdiction. While understanding company law in one's home jurisdiction provides a\n                  valuable foundation for understanding the role that companies play in our world, it is just a starting\n                  point. To more fully appreciate the implications of the corporate form in our world, it is necessary\n                  to understand how the corporate form functions in different jurisdictions taking into consideration\n                  the legal, historical, economic, political and cultural similarities and differences that impact\n                  corporate governance in different jurisdictions – which is the aim of this course. Such an\n                  understanding is valuable for practicing lawyers, policymakers and entrepreneurs in our\n                  increasingly global business environment. This course begins by examining the core legal\n                  characteristics of the corporate form across major jurisdictions. It then examines the common\n                  agency problems that are inherent in the corporate form, compares the legal strategies that each\n                  jurisdiction uses to solve these common problems, and grapples with the increasingly fraught\n                  question about what the “purpose” of the corporate form should be. The course then examines\n                  several of the most significant topics and policy debates in the burgeoning area of comparative\n                  corporate law and governance, with an emphasis on Asia and Singapore.

Further, revenue cannibalization with existing products\n                  and the politics of allocating scarce resources away from established, competing product divisions afflict how new\n                  ventures are created within large corporations.

In view of typically\n                  bureaucratic hierarchies in large corporations, it is important for students to understand how to design and manage\n                  innovation systems for large corporations, as well as how to lead corporate entrepreneurship.",

      "This course provides an introduction to environmental sustainability and human development issues, and the\nmeans of framing, analysing and solving such problems. As environmental and social problems mount around the\nworld, firms have become more attuned to the need to devise new products, services and strategies, and to\ncommunicate these to a variety of stakeholders, even as they cooperate with them.\nEnvironmental sustainability, and more generally, sustainability, has become increasingly important to developed\nand developing nations alike. Typical issues include resource scarcity and polluted environments, but more\nrecently, global climate change has become the primary issue for many. In general, sustainability issues often\nconsist of complex interactions between human activity and the environment. The course will apply several\nacademic perspectives to characterizing these problems and their possible solutions.\nThe course will focus in particular on businesses' role in causing and addressing sustainability problems and on\nhow they moderate their impacts. An important part of addressing the sustainability of firms is the employment\nof various concepts and frameworks that help incorporate the sustainability perspective into firms' strategies\nand operations. To help characterize firms' sustainability and determine appropriate courses of action, the course\nwill cover specific managerial tools and frameworks. The primary focus will be on strategy and business models\nthat support change and its operationalization, but the course will also illustrate the role that “greening” other\nbusiness functions play in the sustainability of the firm, including those of marketing, supply chains, and financing.\nThe course will review core management frameworks to help non-business major students become familiar with\nmore sustainability-specific frameworks, practices and concepts to be covered. These tools are not only means\nfor improving a firm's sustainability performance, but also support its transparent and effective reporting.\nRepresentative examples of sustainability measurement standards will be introduced and their potential impacts\nin advancing corporate sustainability will be discussed. The course will also reflect on the general role of\ninnovation in all of this. Technology issues covered include the role of information technology in addressing\npoverty, and solutions that reorganize the industrial system (e.g. renewable energy policies, and industrial\necosystems or industrial symbiosis, i.e., industries that incorporate recycling loops at regional levels).

However, companies that are able to strategically change their entrenched ways of doing things and then reclaim leading positions are the exception rather than the rule. With the industry 4.0 upon us and fast advancement in digital technologies, firms in many industries would find it even more pressing but challenging to build the managerial capabilities to cope with the digital transformation that will reshape the business landscape tremendously for the future. Against this backdrop, this course discusses how companies can effectively manage the strategic change and digital transformation that will significantly impact the way the business is configured for competitive advantage. Besides the internal managerial challenge, the course also emphasizes that companies must cope with strategic interactions with different industry players to create value collectively and continuously. With respect to digital transformation, the course discusses digital concepts and technologies such as omni-channel, platforms, eco-systems, blockchain, IOT, AI, and cloud computing etc. that impose both challenges and opportunities for strategic change management in the increasingly technology-based, internet-based, and data-based business contexts.",

      "This builds on the course 'Strategy'. Corporate strategy is the pattern of decision-making that determines a firm’s goals and objectives, produces principal policies, defines the range of business to pursue, and pertains to the overall plan for a diversified firm. A firm’s corporate strategy acts as both a catalyst for and a constraint on the strategies of its business units. If the business strategies do not support the firm’s corporate strategy, synergy becomes impossible. Therefore, this progression reinforces the inextricable link between business strategy and corporate strategy, with cases of business integration, strategic alliances, corporate diversification, and mergers and acquisitions. Drawing on these factors, the major objective of this course is to help student to understand: 1) conditions under which different types of corporate strategy have the potential to create (economic and social) value, competitive and corporate advantages; and 2) organizational and managerial systems that must be in place in order to realize this potential value creation.",

This course introduces Design Thinking (similar to the IDEO approach – www.ideo.com) and its application to developing new “things” (i.e. products, services, experiences and business models). The course is divided into four main aspects, all interconnected but separately emphasized: (1) design methodologies (e.g. ethnographic research, brainstorming, prototyping), (2) the “thing” to be designed (3) attitudes and behaviors and (4) design contexts. Design contexts refer to the broader emerging context for designs and business, specifically, society (including different cultures and the poor), and the physical environment. Learning will be primarily experiential in nature – through class discussion, group exercises, and a team project. Guest speakers with practical experience in Design Thinking may be invited as well.",

It prepares students for the complex business environment of today by emphasising the application of academic knowledge accumulated from a range of prior core courses to solving real world problems. The course develops in students an ability to: strategically position the client and its challenge within an environmental context; appropriately scope the challenge of the client; develop and execute a workplan to address the challenge; and develop solutions by establishing a fact-base through directed primary and secondary research, drawing out relevant insights through analytic review, and engaging in abstract idea generation. The course exposes students to the uncertainties and ambiguity that exists within real-world business landscapes and organisational environments of industry clients, as well as, the challenges with engaging busy business executives and convincing them and their organisation of innovative solutions that have been devised by the students that address the client's real-world challenges.",

      "This course initiative rests on the assumption that there is a powerful synergy between ‘sustainability’ and ‘innovation’ in business and society. The term ‘sustainable innovation’ refers to the creation of new market space, products and services or processes driven by social, environmental or sustainability concerns. Just like general innovation, sustainable innovation goes way beyond incremental improvements of products, services or processes. The challenge is to proactively embrace risk management and sustainability considerations (environmental, social, financial) aimed at aligning (novel) business strategies with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to create and capture new value. If managed well by results-oriented, socially aware sustainability leaders, sustainable innovation results not only in greater effectiveness at (intra)organisational levels but also helps to create a cleaner, healthier, fairer (and hopefully more stable) world as envisaged by the circular economy. The urgent need for sustainability has never been greater as evidenced by rapid population growth, pollution, (toxic) waste, plastic accumulating in our oceans, limited natural resources, climate change etc. This course will introduce students to the managerial discipline of innovation management with particular reference to examples of ‘good’ / ‘best’ sustainable innovation practices adopted by both local and international organisations such as City Development Limited (CDL), Banyan Tree, Sustainability Center Freiburg (launched in 2015 by the University of Freiburg in cooperation with five Fraunhofer research institutes), Henkel BeautyCare (whose Social Plastic Ecosystem in partnership with the Plastic Bank social enterprise is aimed at stopping ocean plastic and simultaneously providing opportunities for people in poverty), Procter & Gamble’s Tide Eco-Box (which contains less packaging, 60% less plastic and 30% less water than the current Tide press-tap) and many more.",

As a profession, marketers identify consumer needs, determine which target markets to serve, and develop an optimal product, pricing, promotion, and distribution strategy that best satisfy consumer needs, relative to competition. These decisions—product, price, promotion, and distribution—flow from a rigorous analysis of the constantly evolving market environment and consumer needs (for example, the recent rise of ethical, sustainable, and socially responsible consumption). Marketers serve a vital role in the long-term success of all organizations, profit-oriented as well as not-for-profit, small as well as large. Academically, marketing is a multi-disciplinary field involving the concepts, theories, and methods used to understand exchanges and long-term relationships between buyers and sellers. Through a combination of lectures, discussions, videos, individual and group assignments, and case analyses, the course is designed to cover the fundamental concepts and principles of this challenging field. It is a required course for marketing majors, which complements the theories and skills taught in many of the other majors at SMU.",

While advertising, public relations, sales promotions and personal selling remain the essence of the promotions mix, the intention of this course is to show how these tools are integrated not just within the promotions mix but also beyond the other elements of the marketing mix. The popular mantra applies here: “all elements of the marketing mix have the capacity to communicate.” Major changes primarily impacted by the use of the digital media as well as the global impact of messaging in marketing needs to be strongly factored in today’s study of marketing communications. Ultimately, the end outcome of IMC is its impact on the brand in terms of its ability to elevate brand awareness, brand recognition and ultimately brand preference and loyalty. In all aspects of the topics covered in this course, the focus would be on the connection between marketing communications and branding and how IMC can help organizations build long-term brand equity.\n",

      "Much of marketing in the last half century has been about the single-minded satisfaction of consumer needs and wants. The key to success is thought to lie in thoroughly understanding what these needs and wants are and ensuring the best fit between what is offered as a product and what is desired. This market-led approach, unfortunately, is myopic in its neglect of other stakeholders, such as the environment and the community. This course takes an alternative perspective, premised on climate change, deterioration of the marine ecosystem, and social inequalities as realities. It first examines how current consumption patterns are harming the environment and communities. It then delves into what responsible consumption entails and how consumers can be influenced to make product choices that are sustainable. Theories in psychology will be drawn on to provide that understanding of consumer behaviour. The course will also examine what companies can do to ensure that their marketing activities are aligned with sustainability goals. Case studies of companies with strong sustainability initiatives will be used to illuminate current best practices.",

      "The quality of decision making determines whether a company rides the waves of success or falters. Good decision making is an art and a skill that helps managers to choose and implement the right actions to achieve organizational goals in the face of uncertainty. Good decision making considers not only economic perspectives, but a broad spectrum of objectives to ensure decisions make ethical and business sense. This course focuses on familiarizing you with the foundations of descriptive and prescriptive (and less so, normative) aspects of decision making in individual, group, and organizational settings. Topics include information processing, heuristics and biases, decision frames, managerial risk perceptions, affective influences on decision making, intuition and expertise, ethical decision making, and group decision making.",

      "The aim of this course is to help students learn about the world of HR consulting with an opportunity to develop skills that can be applied to HR consulting projects. To do this, students will learn the whole consulting process. These include consulting methodologies, building and managing client relationships, assessing consulting outcomes and more. The context of the consulting process will be done with reference to the different HR domains and functions. This will help students to have a comprehensive understanding of the people (HR) challenges that organisations face and for which HR consulting may help resolve. As all consulting projects involve change of some form, the key principles of change management will also be explored. This course assumes some level of HR knowledge and practices. Hence, due to the nature of the content that will be covered, it is highly recommended that students take the Human Capital Management course prior to taking this HR Consulting course.",

      "The future of the HR profession lies in analytics. No professional entering the field can expect to succeed in his or her career without a solid understanding and hands-on practice of analytical tools to help in making people decisions. To implement their business strategies effectively, leaders must deal with people issues in a way that allows them to gain competitive advantage through people. The organizations that will win the “war for talent” will be those which are better at identifying and keeping key talent, motivating high performance, developing and promoting staff and predicting future people needs accurately. HR professionals need analytics to address these challenges. For exam-ple, linking pay-for-performance has been a dogma of management, but recent research shows that most incentive plans do not produce the desired behavior, and that pay, in fact, has little correlation to business results. To succeed in the business world, it is imperative that HR provide data-driven answers and insights on how to implement and execute strategy through the people in the organization. The course provides students with practi-cal, hands-on approaches to connect HR policies and practices to business performance. You will review key statis-tics and finance concepts, such as ROI and people productivity; become familiar with available tools such as Workday and Tableau to complement Excel and others; discuss data collection, clean-up and warehousing; prac-tice building descriptive and predictive models; and get hands-on experience in applications for workforce planning, recruitment, compensation, training, career planning and turnover. At the end of the semester, you will be able to put HR analytics skills and tools to good use.\n",

      'This course explores the dimensions of successful service firms through the use of case studies and lectures. It prepares students for enlightened management and suggests creative entrepreneurial opportunities. Outstanding service organizations are managed differently than their "merely good" competitors. Actions are based on totally different assumptions about the way success is achieved. The results show not only in terms of conventional measures of performance but also in the enthusiasm of the employees and quality of customer satisfaction. Beginning with the service encounter, service managers must blend marketing, technology, people, and information to achieve a distinctive competitive advantage. As the service sector is the fastest-growing sector of the economy, this course is also intended to help students discover entrepreneurial opportunities.',

      'Transportation is an integral part of the global supply chain system. Goods cannot move on their own from supply points to demand locations, conferring transportation a central role in the global distribution of freight. Transportation creates value-add in a supply chain by performing the "moving" function in the physical distribution of products and it facilitates international trade and hence globalisation. In broader terms, transport connectivity is often referred to as the lifeline of a nation and is often a precondition for economic progress and development. This course explores the business issues in the design and operation of international transportation systems and underlines their strategic importance to firms and the economy. It draws upon the disciplines of operations management, decision analysis and transport economics to present a holistic view of the theories and practices of transportation management. The course also discusses the core concepts and terminologies of road, air, rail, sea and intermodal transportation, as well as the implications for contemporary supply chain management.',

A focus on reducing environmental impact not only allows these companies to comply with increased regulations but also to reduce their costs, to improve the quality of their products, and to enhance the reputation of their brands. In addition, a new brand of companies is going beyond simply reducing negative externalities and actively tries to create a positive impact on the world. In this course, students will learn how citizens, governments, customers, and employees are creating pressures for more sustainable development and how operations managers are responding to these pressures with principles and frameworks such as waste reduction, pollution prevention, and product stewardship. Through the course, students will study specific tools and concepts such as life cycle assessment (LCA), design for environment (DfE), take-back legislation, green manufacturing, green purchasing, remanufacturing, recycling and by-product synergy. Students will also learn how to create a successful strategy for sustainable operations by incorporating sustainability considerations into business strategy, improvement planning, product and process design, supply management and risk management.",

Largely the answer is that ZARA and Wal-Mart view their operational capabilities as an important and integral part of their competitive advantage. As do other successful companies, such as Procter & Gamble, Toyota, and Coca Cola, they invest strategically in physical plants and facilities, in process and information technology, in employees, suppliers, and distributor relationships, and perhaps most importantly, in organizational practices and know-how. The objective of this course is to provide students with a set of qualitative frameworks and quantitative tools to analyze and guide the long-term, strategic decisions for a company's operations function.

      "Global Supply Chain refers to the cross-border organization of the activities required to produce goods or services and bring them to consumers through inputs and various phases of development, production and delivery (International Labour Organization). As global trade is dependent on global supply chain, companies make investment decisions to globalize, setting up production facilities overseas and sales offices beyond their domestic market. The key aspects for companies embarking on global Supply Chain involves cross-border sourcing, overseas production, global planning and international distribution, where the various components for a final product could be sourced from different parts of the world, and manufactured at one or multiple locations and have them distributed to different markets. Managing a global supply chain is also no longer about driving down cost, but it is how companies can maintain their competitiveness and global supply chains has never been more challenging and disruptive in the current environment of pandemic and geo-political tensions. In addition, e-commerce has also changed the design for global supply chain as well. This course provides students with a practical lens and frameworks regarding global supply chain. Students learn the key concepts on global supply chain management, together with special topics on maritime logistics, technology and green supply chain that affects the development of global supply chain. Understanding them would enable the students to better appreciate the complexities when handling global supply chain activities in future. Topics covered include: considerations for global sourcing, selection criteria for global production locations, planning in an uncertainty, volatility, complexity and ambiguity environment, various international methods of entry to overseas market, e-commerce distribution, incoterms and different modes of transportation, terms of payment, customs requirements, and maritime distribution network. Business cases and real-life examples will be used in the course. Industry speakers will be invited as guest lecturers to share the challenges and practical solutions relating to global supply chain. This course is highly relevant for the current business environment and is recommended for those interested in working for global companies managing cross-border business.",

Does the media foster understanding, insight, and hold the powerful to account, or does it spread discord, misinformation, and maintain power hierarchies? These are the kinds of questions that students can find answers to in this project-based research design course. During the course students will learn how to write a rigorous empirical research paper and develop the methodological skills to survey public opinion and systematically code media content. After studying how to plan a content analysis and public opinion survey, students will work in groups and write a research proposal on a topic of their choosing. Potential topics are wide ranging. For instance, they could relate to elections, identity politics, migration, protest, conflict, as well as economic, business, environmental, health, or educational issues. Students then choose to design a survey or a content analysis. For the survey, students develop a questionnaire plan to gather public opinions on the media or preform a survey experiment to understand the impact of media. Students doing a content analysis will develop a codebook to code newspapers, TV, film, social media, or the web. After analyzing their unique data, student projects culminate in a presentation and an original research paper of approximately 9,000 words.",

What can we learn through comparisons that we would be unable to from the study of political systems one by one? Why compare, and how? These questions should be in the forefront of this course. Topics include critical comparative methods, political power, political institutions (executive, legislative, judiciary, and bureaucracy), capitalism, globalization, and federalism in developed and developing countries.",

Each week, we will concentrate on primary texts by canonical thinkers ranging from Plato to Foucault. In discussing the works of individual political philosophers, our objective is not to study each thinker's thought for its own sake but to investigate the fundamental concepts and questions they brought to the fore. We will regularly ground the abstract ideas we examine in empirical phenomena, both past and present. This enterprise will involve textual interpretation and critical reflection in order to systematically scrutinize what we mean by “politics,” where we draw the boundaries of the “political,” and how we interrelate different political concepts and schemes.",

What is a just and equitable global economic and information order? How much force should peacekeepers be allowed to use?

To understand how people make choices or decisions, we need to understand the thinking, reasoning and judgment processes involved. In addition, decision and choice situations often involve making tradeoffs (e.g. price versus quality) or evaluating multiple different options and alternatives. With limited human cognitive capacity and the multiple task demands involved in choice and decision making, it appears that reasoning or decision-making processes are challenging. This course will help you understand these complexities and processes. It will cover topics such as judgments of risk and uncertainty, affect and decision making, self-control, heuristics and biases. In addition, we will connect decision-making theories to other areas of application, such as negotiation, consumer behaviour, and team processes.",

      'Modern societies extol busyness and may even regard work as a defining aspect of one\'s life. Consequently, leisure is often relegated as "time off work" and sometimes leads people to construe work and leisure as opposites. This promotes the pursuit of passive and convenient leisure in contrast to their more goal-directed and effortful work activities. Unfortunately, research shows that passive leisure is not restorative nor provides important ingredients to meaningful living. In this course, we examine people’s motivation to work and its reciprocal relationship with their pursuit of leisure. It aims to help students apply to their daily lives what the psychological literature advocates about quality leisure activities and living a "good" life, which will also help them flourish at work.',

The same framework has subsequently been applied to the pricing and hedging of other more exotic financial products.\n    The course is an interesting mix of finance and mathematics. Students will see that fundamental financial concepts like the no-arbitrage principle, coupled with careful mathematical reasoning, lead to a sophisticated framework of valuation and hedging.\n    The mathematical tools employed are calculus, stochastic calculus, probability theory and numerical methods. A good background in calculus and probability is assumed. The other mathematical requisites will be furnished during the course.",

We use empirical materials from food-related issues—agricultural production, food manufacturing and processing, food distribution and retail, food consumption, and global food trade—to learn about theories in environmental sociology and political ecology, and discuss the possibility of sustainable food systems and agriculture and debate the future environmental sustainability. The first part of the course is devoted to introducing students to key theoretical perspectives in environmental sociology. Environmental sociology examines the changing relationship between social systems and the environment and explores how environmental issues emerge—and can be addressed—as social problems. In the second part, we take these theoretical perspectives to investigate the food system. We explore how society and environment interacts throughout the food system, how the current food system faces challenges in sustainability, and how sustainable alternatives can be developed.",

Students will develop essential skills to thrive in the modern workplace – they will explore virtual collaboration tools, hone their interpersonal and intercultural competence, and employ data storytelling principles to craft persuasive narratives for business proposals. In the first half of the course, students work in SMU teams to communicate their recommendations persuasively through corporate documents like executive summaries and Slidedocs. Through whole-class and small-group discussions, students explore theories on virtual communication and working in remote teams, and familiarize themselves with tools for cultural analysis and virtual collaboration. In the culminating capstone project in collaboration with the University of Southern California (USC), students will work in global teams comprising students from universities across Asia, Europe and America to develop a proposal for a corporate client. Past industry partners of the VBP project included companies such as Google, Starbucks, Netflix, Tesla and SpaceX. Over 6 weeks, students collaborate virtually with their global counterparts to craft a report to the client of their choice, recommending strategies to enhance the client’s corporate reputation. In the course of the project, students use social and AI-driven collaboration tools, navigate cross-cultural team processes and learn to collaborate effectively across borders and time zones. The deliverables in this course can be included in students’ portfolio of written and reflective work to showcase their ability to produce industry and discipline-specific communication outcomes. USC will award certificates of achievement to all participants.",

While the Writing & Reasoning course, taken by most SMU students in their first year, focuses on breadth, here the students will be deepening their skills by exploring and writing about more complex issues in society and business. Students will engage with the need for deeper research, better audience analysis, and more structured writing, with a more nuanced adaptation to the context appropriate to their intended publications. Students will consider and respond to meaningful real-world issues and situations in each of the three written projects. They will explore not only what other people have said about the issues that they confront, but also develop and communicate their own responses. The finished pieces will form the basis of a portfolio of written work to showcase their ability to think critically, conduct appropriate literature research, analyse their findings, argue their case, and produce professional communication outcomes. This portfolio will be a valuable addition to their resumes when they graduate. The final project will be an in-depth feature piece written for either Rice Media (https://www.ricemedia.co/) or the Skeptic Magazine (https://www.skeptic.org.uk/). Rice Media, and Skeptic Magazine editors advise the students during the Week 10 presentations, and students will have the chance to have their work published by the media outlet that they write for after the term finishes.",

This special topic on Arts Entrepreneurship and Creative Economies was chosen because the arts today must be equipped to deal with the radical socio-economic and environmental changes that we are living through, from evolving audience behaviours to the relentless pressures of inflation and a boundless array of inequities. Additionally, arts organisations can no longer rely on pre-pandemic business models to sustain their survival, relevance and influence.

This topic will focus on enabling students to adopt an entrepreneurial mindset to identify, frame and shape the developments, challenges and opportunities facing the cultural and creative industries today and in the near future. They will acquire conceptual and practical skills to address these challenges using a cultural economics approach and cultural value perspective, particularly within a Singapore context. Upon completion, students will better understand: (1) the dynamic development and competition of the arts as exceptional and creative economies in Singapore, (2) the ambidexterity required to support the creation of conducive conditions to develop works of art, creative goods and services, and (3) how to develop evidence-based insights and value-based strategies from existing empirical case studies and ventures. **This course will require preexisting arts management and Singapore art world knowledge.",

Asia is no exception – over the last twenty years, there has been a proliferation of large-scale arts and cultural infrastructure, as well as an energetic bubbling of artist-led initiatives in cities such as Singapore, Jakarta, Hong Kong and Seoul.\n\n    This course aims to explore the growing and diversified roles of “arts” and “culture” in contemporary urbanism, and to interrogate how categories such as “arts” and “culture” can transform cities. In particular, this course will focus on the changing spatial conditions and challenges of the arts and culture in Asia, with a focus on the role of Singapore in the region during this time of rapid change, global complexity and increasing austerity.\n\n    Through an analysis of a range of real-world case studies and experiential learning, students will critically consider questions such as: What are the roles of arts and culture in cities today? Can the arts and culture become key drivers of urban growth, enabling cities to forge and maintain global connections? Do they differentiate cities, and generate distinctive place-identities amidst a globalising world? How do art events and exhibitions like biennales influence cultural and city development, and give rise to more diverse, reflective and vibrant societies? Can the arts and culture create, reinforce and enhance sense of place and belonging in global cities, especially for the less privileged? What are some of the particularities and specificities of the arts within cities in the Asia-Pacific region?\n\n    Ultimately, this course aspires to provide students with a reflexive understanding of the unique arts ecologies in Asia, and a heightened appreciation of the significance of the arts to urban processes, practices and everyday life.",

This third age of human existence is characterised by retirement from full-time work and a new way of spending time (Carr & Komp, 2011). Through class discussions and group projects, students will dive deeper into disciplines like gerontology, social sciences (intergenerational; social connectedness), public policy (successful ageing), economics (retirement) and technological developments in the ageing space. Students will explore case studies and challenges of a rapidly ageing society in Singapore and around the world such as Japan, China, USA, Australia, Netherlands etc.",

      "This course explores what literature can tell us about the changing nature of gender and ethnic identities across modern Asian cultures. We interrogate what ‘selfhood’ means to a range of established and emerging Asian writers, asking how and why they construct gender and ethnic identities in their works, and what insights this provides into the Asian psyche. We begin by interrogating gender in Singapore, asking how dramatists and novelists envision life as a ‘woman’ or a ‘man’ here. We then circle outwards across Indonesia, India and Iran, tracing how letters, novels, films and graphic novels have been used to create and challenge gender norms from the colonial 19th century to the postcolonial 21st. Next, we look at ethnicity, debating its relative mutability, and querying the importance of physical markers of ‘racial’ difference relative to evolving national borders and spiritual and societal practices. We trace how Singaporean and Malaysian writers construct ethnicity in their prose fiction, before considering how authors further afield in East Asia (Japan and China) and West Asia (Turkey and Afghanistan) have re-interpreted communal identities over time. We conclude by considering the future of ethnic and gender identities in Asia. By the end of this literary odyssey, students will have gained a wide-ranging appreciation of how modern Asian writers envision gender and ethnicity, and contemplated the relevance of these fictive visions to their own sense of selfhood as young adults living in Asia.",

      "In the 21st century business world, it is no longer common for businesses to pursue only profit maximisation or revenue growth at all costs. There is a greater global impetus for organisations to look at their businesses holistically to attain a triple bottom line, and pursue sustainable environmental, social and governance (ESG) outcomes for their stakeholders. This course seeks to explore how law promotes sustainability in the business world across various corporate functions, and how it holds businesses accountable for their sustainability practices. It will be taught from a practitioner’s real-world perspective and give students a glimpse into the interplay of law, sustainability and business in practice.",

    description: `What is law? How is law related to justice? This course enables law students to step back to reflect upon what they have learnt in law school thus far by engaging philosophical concepts of law and justice through studying selected representative works of jurisprudence. Non-law students who are interested in philosophy or in thinking about law’s nature and its role in society will also have the opportunity to study these ideas as expounded by famous legal philosophers.

We will consider accounts of law offered by several legal positivists and modern natural law theorists, and challenges posed by alternative critical accounts. How do modern and critical accounts of law shape our thinking about the nature and purpose of law? How does adopting a particular account of law impact the practice of law? How can we, as lawyers or citizenry, harness law’s potential as a tool for transforming society?

Through this course, students will have a unique opportunity to engage their hearts and minds in relation to the concepts of law and justice. Students will also be encouraged to relate the theories studied to current contexts (e.g. laws that restrict personal liberty, unjust laws, how judges decide cases, and so on). The course's focus is on critique of ideas and not mere description of doctrine. The methods of assessment will be intentionally geared towards facilitating critical thought. This course encourages students to formulate their own theses about law and justice, and meaningfully understand their purpose in the legal process.

This course also offers law students a chance to study selected representative texts in jurisprudence in greater detail than in the law core module, Legal Theory & Philosophy. Students are not required to have done Legal Theory & Philosophy before taking this course.`,

For SMU students in particular, the rising China will most likely enter your future careers and lives in some consequential ways. This course takes you beyond China’s economic growth record, which everybody can find in news headlines. It situates China’s economic growth in the whole-scale transformation of the Chinese society—of which it is part and parcel—to understand what made the economic miracle possible, what shapes its trajectory, and what threatens its sustainability. We will also learn a novel analytical framework that provides us an anchor point from which to observe the fast-changing Chinese society and to gauge the social impact of China’s economic growth.",

    description: `“Globalization” is one of the most important concepts for understanding the nature of the contemporary world, where various connections and interdependencies continue to proliferate and intensify across national borders. Especially in Singapore, we live globalization on a daily basis; for example, the mixing of various cultures and peoples from the East and the West, and the growing business interests and financial investments from all over the world. Moreover, the postcolonial context of Singapore sheds light on historical connections between contemporary globalization and legacies of imperialism. Thus, Singapore is a “natural laboratory” for studying the trajectories and frontiers of globalization. In this course, we will examine both theories and case studies of globalization to understand changing realities of Singapore and the world at large.

      "Historically, the software development process was linear, and code was deployed infrequently. Today, it couldn't be more different: companies like Amazon reportedly deploy new code every 11.7 seconds, and software development culture in general has shifted towards iterating with agility. In IT Solution Lifecycle Management, students will be introduced to some state-of-the-art practices for building, testing, deploying, and maintaining software, in a way that supports frequent and rapid iterations. In particular, they will study the 'DevOps' approach, which embodies the idea that development and operation teams should work closely together throughout the entire software lifecycle. As well as studying examples of this culture through some real-world case studies, students will also gain hands-on experience, by learning how to build loosely coupled systems based on microservices, and automating the process of testing, containerising, and orchestrating them using a modern continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.",

      "A key challenge in many AI systems is being able to handle (reason, plan or learn) problems with uncertainty. For instance, a self-driving car needs to handle imperfect visibility of the world and also uncertainty about the movements of other cars or obstacles. Similarly, in aggregation systems (e.g., Grab, Food Panda), positioning supply (taxis, delivery boys) at the right locations requires handling uncertainty about customer demand. Playing strategic games like Go, Chess etc. requires learning strategy that works against opponents whose strategy is not known in advance. This course will equip students with core concepts and practical experience in doing reasoning, learning and planning in the presence of uncertainty.",

      "Natural Language Communication (NLC) is the convergence of a diverse set of human language technologies that enable computer systems to interact reasonably with people in a natural and human-like way. NLC requires considering human language as the central part of communicative channel, where the computer should be able to perform a series of language processing actions: - It should correctly process our written or spoken utterances as input in order to respond accordingly; - It should allow technology to understand complex sentences, which may contain multiple pieces of information and many turns of requests; - It can then react by reasoning and/or interrogating and synthesising various data from third-party systems or external knowledge, and use that information in generating sensible responses. In this course, we will cover diverse fundamental methods and techniques across the themes of natural language processing, understanding and generation that are indispensable for constructing modern NLC systems. We will be focused on introducing and discussing the underlying computational models, data resources, toolkits, and practising them in developing interactive information seeking, dialogue, and cross-language communication systems. This includes but is not limited to exploration of a few conversational AI applications such as question answering, chatbots, virtual personal assistants, and dialogue management.",

An appreciation for the potential scope of government failure is also developed here to allow for a more holistic approach when contemplating intervention. It then proceeds to discuss the economics underlying social transfer schemes and a variety of other public sector programs that falls outside the ambit of the so-called "minimum" role. Here, governmental expenditure programs such as programs on health care, social security and education come into focus. Finally, the module discusses the financing of government programs bringing into focus the taxation system. The efficiency and distributional effects of different taxes and their implication on the choice of financing method and on project evaluation are some of the issues that will be discussed here. An introduction to optimal taxation theory is also included here. From time to time, during the exposition of the module, reference will be made to the US experience and to the Singapore experience to provide the practical motivation underlying a number of the ideas covered.`,

      "The income per capita in the United States and Western Europe is around fifty times greater than in much of sub-Saharan Africa. This prompts the question: Why are some countries rich and others poor? From around 1870 until the Second World War, Japan’s income per capita remained around 25 percent of U.S. income per capita. After the substantial reforms put in place at the end of the war, Japanese relative income rose sharply so that today Japanese standard of living is roughly two-thirds that of the U.S. level. The rapid catch-up was also achieved in the post-war period by several other Asian economies including Singapore. What is it that makes it possible for countries to produce growth miracles? For much of world history, people lived at subsistence levels well described by Thomas Malthus. Around the nineteenth century, however, there was an escape from Malthusian stagnation beginning in Europe. What is the engine of economic growth? Gasoline contributes to air pollution as it powers our cars. The release of carbon dioxide as oil and gasoline are burned contributes to global warming. What is the relationship between economic growth and environmental quality? These are the questions that we will pursue in this course.",

We first introduce economic models that focus on cross-country differences (in technology, in factor endowment), imperfect competition, or increasing returns to scale as the rationale for trade and the consequences of opening to trade on national welfare and on income distribution within and across countries. We then examine the economic causes and effects of increasing trade in intermediate goods or services through international outsourcing and foreign direct investment. In the third component of the course, we examine efficiency properties of frequently used trade measures, the political economy of trade protection, and welfare effects of preferential trade liberalizations such as free trade agreements against the backdrop of multilateral trade liberalizations sponsored by the WTO.

      "This course is a primer on behavioural economics, which examines how psychological, social, and cognitive factors influence economic decision-making. Behavioural economics challenge and enrich the rational-choice framework that permeates neoclassical economics by emphasizing that economic choices are also conditioned by social and cultural forces. In behavioural economics, psychological insights intersect with economic theory to demonstrate how individuals, groups, and organizations make decisions that depart from the predictions of traditional economic models. Students will gain a deep understanding of prospect theory, cognitive biases, and heuristics—the building blocks of behavioural theory. At the same time, students will also explore how social preferences, shared values, beliefs, norms, customs and institutions influence economic choices. Understanding the interplay between these aspects of culture and behavioural economics is crucial for creating policies, interventions, and business strategies that are both effective and culturally sensitive. This course is ideal for students in economics, business, psychology, social sciences and related fields who are interested in understanding the behavioural and social aspects of decision-making. The course will help equip students with the knowledge and skills to analyse, explain, and predict real-world behaviour especially in contexts characterised by risk and uncertainty, including consumer choices, marketing, financial decision-making, public policy, political outcomes, and organizational strategy, and to learn how to evaluate and design interventions and strategies to influence decisions and improve outcomes in these settings. Students will enhance their critical and interdisciplinary thinking, analytical skills, and creativity by integrating behavioural concepts with traditional economic frameworks, preparing them to address complex challenges in academia, industry, or government roles.",

There are two main parts to this course. The first part explains the functions and structure of Financial Markets, helping students to understand the meaning and behavior of interest rates. That serves as the background for the second part, in which money and monetary policy theory and strategies will be introduced. Both parts will highlight the management roles of the Central Bank.

      "Today’s corporates are operating in various degrees of maturity and awareness of sustainable business practices in the respective sectors they operate in. With emerging community and public conscience for sustainability, together with greater regulatory and national or international pledges to meet climate and other sustainability targets, corporates across the Asia Pacific region are in a unique position to gain a competitive edge in sustainability, or simply to maintain their social license to operate. Financial institutions are also increasingly interested and under increasing pressure to direct finance to environmentally and socially responsible outcomes. Sustainable finance instruments present levers for corporates to raise capital specifically directed to accelerating the company’s and the sector’s sustainable operations, investments, and standards. This course couples established and emerging theory on how finance can be used to address sustainability challenges. It covers diverse aspects of sustainable finance, including the structuring of financial instruments with sustainability elements to target varying customer/ sectoral needs. The course also explores the power of corporate engagement as a lever for sustainability, steering strategic direction, enabling sustainable finance leading to materially impactful outcomes. By the end of this course, students will gain a foundation in sustainable finance instruments and corporate engagement strategies.",

      "This SMU-X overseas course integrates academic learning with experiential projects provided by international organizations. It challenges students to apply their disciplinary knowledge and skills to real-world problems through interdisciplinary methods. The course collaborates with corporate, non-profit, and government-sector organizations abroad for project design and content delivery. Students will receive mentorship from both faculty and practitioners of these partner organizations, guiding them to develop practical and implementable solutions. Although the course demands significant effort and time from students, its journey and outcomes can be highly rewarding. All SMU-XO courses meet the Global Exposure requirement. With a focus on project-based experiential learning and cross-cultural understanding, SMU-XO courses aim to: • Enhance awareness of interdisciplinary connections and differences, encouraging knowledge integration to address issues or challenges. • Foster a deeper understanding of business opportunities and challenges in various global markets and economies relevant to students' interests. • Familiarize students with informal networks and emphasize leveraging SMU-related networks in a global context. • Provide global exposure to cultivate culturally sensitive global citizens. • Encourage adaptation to new environments and leadership development. • Promote creative and critical problem-solving skills. • Support sound decision-making in complex situations. • Enhance collaborative and productive teamwork. This course focuses on Southeast Asia, but may include South Asia, East Asia, and Oceania. The partner organization will have a need for strategic planning and communication, whether they have never conducted such planning or need to update an existing plan. In addressing that need, students will develop a communication strategy within the social marketing and strategic communication frameworks based on fieldwork in the host community. The first half of the semester involves lectures about key issues in sustainable development, social marketing, and strategic communication. It also involves discussions with representatives from the partner organization, partner organisations, and communication practitioners who can guide preparation for the fieldwork. During recess week, and with the support of the partner organisation, students will interview, document, and observe members of the host community as part of formative research in formulating a communication strategy. This immersive experience will provide students with new perspectives on some of the challenges facing people and the planet. It will be an opportunity to put theory into practice and, hopefully, have a positive impact in the world. In the second half of the semester, students will refine their communication strategies and develop communication collaterals. They will also reflect on the long-term sustainability of the strategy and how to evaluate its effectiveness. The semester ends with the presentation of the communication strategy before a panel composed of the course instructor and representatives from the partner organisation and other interested individuals.",

Voice- and paper-based trading have been replaced with electronic channels linking up market participants globally. Technology has equipped traders with real-time price and market information, and enables performance of complex data analytics to advance competitive edge. Open outcry trading floors at exchanges have been replaced by automated trade matching and straight-thru-processing (STP) has replaced error-prone paper-based settlements processing resulting in shorter settlement cycles. But amid the loss of colorful trading jackets and the hype around technological advances, the fundamentals of markets, trading and risk management have not changed. And in order to provide products and services salient to the financial market community, one must understand these fundamentals. This course introduces the roles within the types of markets, products and services, and how associated risks are harnessed and managed. Focus will be placed on the foreign exchange and equities products and the processes that support the trading and settlement of these instruments. The course will include the schematic architecture and design of the systems that support these processes. Learners will be placed in multiple simulations, taking on different roles from broker, to trader to risk manager, allowing them to gain insights to the practical application of what otherwise remains theory.",

      "Contracts are the foundation of commercial life. This course aims to equip students with a firm appreciation of the unique character of contracts as a form of voluntary undertakings. This course begins by examining the concepts relating to the formation of contract, as well as how an otherwise validly formed contract may have its effect nullified by issues such as misrepresentation, duress, undue influence, etc. Contract Law 1 will be followed in the second semester by LAW102 Contract Law 2 which will go on to look at issues relating to how a contract may be discharged, what sort of remedies are available when a contractual obligation is breached, as well as certain issues relating to contracts for the sale of goods. Over the two courses, the student will be sensitized to the role of the law in facilitating commerce, respecting legitimate expectations, and guarding against unfair exploitation of economic or social weakness. The study of the subject will also provide students with an excellent opportunity to observe, evaluate and critique developments in the law as it responds to the fast-changing and dynamic environment of the world of commerce.",

It is important to realise, though, that Singapore’s legal system and that of its constituent laws are not mere offshoots of the English. Many substantive and institutional features as well as rules and practices within the system have changed over time. Broadly speaking, topics include Singapore’s legal history, the sources of law in Singapore, constitutional and institutional framework of the Singapore State, disruptions to and the regulation of the legal sector. Time permitting, a trip to a State institution may be organised. The main objectives of the course are, firstly, to familiarise students to various key aspects of the Singapore legal system; and, secondly, to equip candidates with a set of fundamental legal knowledge to springboard to other courses within the core curriculum.",

      "This course aims to introduce students to the basic principles of common law and equity as applied to property, both immoveable and moveable including intellectual property. Beginning with an exploration of what ownership of land means, this course will consider how land can be dealt with at common law and in equity, before taking a look at how some of these complexities have receded, given the adoption and universal application of the Torrens registration system in Singapore. In the middle part of this course, the question of ownership and transfer of moveable property at common law and in equity will be considered with particular attention to the difficulties posed by intangible moveable property in the form of intellectual property rights as well as other choices in action. The final part of the course examines the creation of security interests over immoveable and moveable property and the problems relating to determining the priorities of competing security interests. Comparisons may be drawn with alternative systems of property law, e.g. the scheme of security interests set out in the Uniform Commercial Code and the treatment of property generally in the American Restatement on Property.",

      "This course seeks to provide an overview of what an ambitious Singapore entrepreneur may face in his/her journey to grow a business in Singapore. Partners@WongPartnership will guide the students through each stage of the entrepreneur’s journey and discuss the legal issues the entrepreneur will encounter at the different stages of building the business. The journey begins when the entrepreneur first look at the options that are available to start a business in Singapore. While most entrepreneurs will opt for a private limited company as the start-up vehicle, there may well be other options that better suit the business needs. Most start-ups will then explore ways of raising funds to support the business growth, looking first to venture capital providers and then bank borrowings, before eventually raising monies on the capital markets through an IPO with a listing on the Singapore Exchange. Life as a listed company on the SGX will be more exciting, as the entrepreneur learns to cope with stricter corporate governance standards. Pursuing M&A opportunities as a listed company is no longer a decision that entrepreneur can make on his own accord. A successful listed company will in turn become the target of interest by other companies or private equity buy-out funds, looking to acquire and/or take the listed company private. Unfortunately, leveraged buy outs don’t always end on a happy note; we will explore at the end of the course the scenario where the company struggles with debt servicing and going through the ensuing debt restructuring to save the business. Some companies emerge from a debt structuring in a good shape. Some don’t.",

    description: `International commercial arbitration has held itself out to be a fast, convenient and confidential means of binding dispute resolution. Since 1958, the wide spread recognition of arbitration awards by different countries, the promulgation of a model law of arbitration and a growing acceptance of a uniform set of best practices has increased the profile of arbitration. This is more so in Asia than anywhere else. In a region of varied court systems, arbitration offers certainty, due process, confidentiality and a quiet resolution. Or does it?

As arbitration is consensual, almost all arbitrations arise from a clause in an agreement. The agreement itself can address a myriad of dealings from joint ventures to distributorships to acquisitions. Lawyers in all commercial disciplines need to appreciate what their clients agree to when an arbitration clause is in their document.

The course is a study of the core principles applicable to international commercial arbitration, the main international rules and of the values adopted by Singapore in its efforts to become an international commercial arbitration centre.`,

      "This course offers an introduction to insurance law with a focus on the marine aspect, from which insurance law developed – many of the fundamental principles of insurance were historically established by leading marine insurance cases, and they now apply both in marine and non-marine insurance. It seeks to provide students with an understanding of the key principles in this key component of commercial law. The course will primarily focus on Singapore and English law – the London insurance market is traditionally regarded as the industry leader in the development of insurance law and practice. Notably, Lloyd's of London and the London Company Market insure risks placed all over the globe. As such, English law has an outsized influence in the development of insurance law and practice. Students can expect to have a wider comprehension of risk assessment and assess the terms of contracts of insurance with a view to protecting the interests of the insured at the conclusion of a contract of insurance.",

We will start with an overview of the various IPRs around the world and the more important differences between particular countries, which are important when considering an international IP strategy. The course will then turn to look at different ways of dealing with IPRs: assignment or sale, licensing, and joint ventures; and the different challenges they present. We will look in detail at the provisions to be included in assignments and licence agreements of the different IPRs. After that, we will look at how to conduct IP due diligence in corporate transactions, what to look for and how to negotiate the documentation. After that, IP issues in the IT industry will be discussed, as well as those you will come across in relation to using the Internet or setting up an Internet-based business. Finally, we will consider how the enforcement of IPRs plays a critical role in extracting value.",

    description: `This course deals with the rapidly growing area of private international mediation and multi-tiered dispute resolution processes that have mediation as an element. It offers participants a framework for understanding cross-border law and practice in this field.

Imagine the following scenario: A Singaporean mediator is asked to mediate a professional negligence dispute. The plaintiff is based in Indonesia, the defendant accounting firm is in the Netherlands, and the defendant’s insurer has its headquarters in the United States. All agree to attend mediation in Singapore. The preliminary discussions and meetings, however, take place via email and video-conference with all parties in their home countries. The mediation occurs and the parties reach a settlement, which the parties’ legal representatives draft into contractual form.

Such cross-border mediations involve:
• international and intercultural competencies;
• online and face-to-face mediation protocols; and
• knowledge of private international law in relation to the substantive and procedural aspects of mediation.

The course will address these and other topical issues, including enforceability of international mediated settlement agreements, to provide participants with a current overview of international legal practice and trends in this field. Participants will have the opportunity to develop specialised mediation skills relevant to cross-border settings.`,

    description: `In the information age, the production and management of data will define the future of governance and businesses. The ‘data economy’ renders digitized information - promulgating at ever increasing speed – a valuable asset through the use of data analytics. It has also led to a fundamental shift in power and markets. The emergence of disruptive technological and business innovations is one prominent example of such a change. New economies are formed, such as from the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the development of ‘cognitive services’, the digitization of goods and the provision of storage/sharing and management services. Governments, including the Singapore public sector, are also aware of the importance of data to governance and to the future of the economy and are driving innovations and technology usage within that sector as well as in society generally through the Smart Nation initiative and Digital Economy drive. Substantial research and development are also encouraged in this field.

These fundamental shifts also lead to many problems and challenges related to different types of data and data sets. For Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) and the data economy generally, cybersecurity is a major concern. In relation to personal data and digital communications, there are various threats to different forms of privacy. Other current issues surrounding data are the ‘fake news’ phenomenon and the persistent threats to intellectual property. On the flipside, these developments have also led to new industries (and careers) such as in the areas of cybersecurity and data protection.

The objective of this course is to prepare students who are interested in data protection law and may have an interest in making a career in this nascent industry that is set to grow. Students will first be introduced to the data economy as a concept and to the real changes to the market and to society as well as the various forms and categorisations of data and the legal aspects to these data sets. The second part of the course will then focus on privacy law and its relationship with data protection (DP) law. In this context, comparative study will be made of privacy and DP regimes of significance (e.g. OECD, EU, APEC, etc.). Third, students will then focus their study on the Singapore Personal Data Protection Act (and other relevant laws) – in particular, the data protection and do not call provisions - by looking at its history, objective, scope/application and possible future developments e.g. Data Protection Ecosystem and PDPA Act Review. Comparative study of similar concepts and processes in other jurisdictions will also be assessed in the course of the study of the Singapore PDPA. The fundamental concepts and workings of the PDPA will be examined in depth. In the fourth part of the course, practitioners from the PDPC and the private sector will provide their perspectives on this process and a holistic and practical viewpoint to the study.

After completing this course, students will be able to use what they have learnt to obtain professional certification such as from the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP) and PDPC with a view to practice in this area as a privacy counsel, privacy professional, manager and/or technologist. This will prepare students for a career in this growing field, or at least provide them with the skills and knowledge when dealing with such issues as a TMT lawyer, legal counsel or even as a general legal practitioner that will possibly encounter these issues at work.`,

      "As businesses increasingly embrace the use of technology in domestic and cross-border operations, such as blockchain technology, cloud technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) and digitalized trade documents, it is necessary for lawyers and legal policy-makers to not only appreciate the complex legal and policy issues arising from such use of technology, but to also help provide clear legal thinking and innovative ideas in resolving such issues. This unique course aims to provide students with an opportunity to learn about and confront a selection of such issues, develop an understanding of real-world legal-policy issues and exercise skills in critical thinking and creativity to produce usable law and policy recommendations. The issues are selected based on their topicality, feedback from industry, importance to Singapore and ASEAN and a review of academic and business literature. Students will be guided in an exploration and analysis of cross-border trade law issues relating to the intersection of commerce and technology. In the first part of the course, an explanation of the some key issues will be provided to help students understand the broader context of trade in the digital economy. Students will then be exposed to a number of issues which are confronting policy-makers and the private sector, so that they may conduct legal research and craft clear and cogent law and policy recommendations from their findings. Industry professionals will help to provide feedback and discuss students’ findings and recommendations. Industry contacts in this course are likely to be from the fields of finance, technology, commerce, policy/strategy and law. In addition to interactive learning with the course instructor (Professor Locknie Hsu), students will also receive industry and policy insights from 1-3 industry experts (who may be from the commerce and finance, technology and/or policy-making sectors).",

      "The SMU-X course “Business Consulting” is jointly offered by SMU and the University of St.Gallen. It is designed to allow students to translate classroom knowledge into professional experience. It is a unique oppor-tunity to learn more about consulting services and apply theoretical knowledge to a real business project. The core focus of this class rests on a group work built around a real world business project offered by one of our corpo-rarte partners. For each session (G1 and G2), we are collaborating with more than twelve different corporate partners with each student group benefitting from an exclusive relationship to their own corporate partner. The corporate projects cover different industries and different topics. Students are invited to share their preferences with which corporate partner (and thereby in which industry or on what topic focus) they wish to work and gain experience. This SMU-X course is a combination of advanced in-class learning and practical interaction with the business world via project work and guest lecturers who work/have worked with major consultancy companies such as McKinsey, BCG, or Bain. The lectures introduce the world of consulting by teaching the basic steps and tools used during the consulting process. You will learn how consultants frame, analyse and solve problems and how they present their solutions to their clients. You will obtain tools and frameworks to reduce complexity and structure a project. Sev-eral mini cases and lived situations with your corporate partner will help you to develop an understanding of how to approach a business project and manage the relationship with your corporate partner as a client. Guest lectures will provide you with industry insights and hands-on experiences about the day-to-day business of a consultant. The unique opportunity to explore, learn, and directly apply competencies in a real life, multidisciplinary, team-based consulting experience with a company/organization is the distinguishing feature of this course. You will be working in teams for (large) corporations or smaller startups, acting as student consultants working on real challenges the organizations presently face. The solutions you develop will be presented to the senior management of the compa-nies. In previous semesters, our corporate partners included DBS (banking), Adidas (sports apparel), WWF (nature conservancy), Nestlé (nutrition), SingPost (logistics), Lufthansa (airline), CapitaLand (real estate), Sygnum (fintech), Lazada (E-commerce) and many more.",

      "This course is intended to introduce students to the role and importance of selling as a complement to marketing function in an organization. The two concepts are overlapping that one often says that “marketing needs selling” and “no selling can take place without marketing.” The instructor will guide students on how the sales function is operationalized in different kinds of marketing organizations as the scope can vary from consumer and retail marketing, trade marketing, services marketing, and business-to-business marketing. Students will cover this course under two parallel themes–the process of selling and the role of the professional sales team through the process of sales management. Students will learn the underlying body of marketing theory that underpins the study of sales management and personal selling. You will also learn some of the important principles of effective presentations related to sales proposals to organizational customers. A key delivery for this course would be for students to develop a case scenario to simulate a sales strategy involving target prospect calling, sales presentation and negotiations leading to sales conversion. The sales management course is focused on consumer trade marketing (pushing products through the channel) as well as business-to-business marketing applications for sales of business products and services to corporate customers.",

      "As a business professional, a firm understanding of employment law is crucial for driving business outcomes. At the minimum, this ensures that your legal obligations surrounding employees are always met. Yet, its importance extends far beyond legal compliance – employment law considerations are also vital in informing strategic management decisions across key areas, from workforce planning (e.g. cross-border recruitment, restructuring/downsizing), ESG performance (e.g. managing diversity and inclusion, workplace safety, grievances), risk management (e.g. protecting company assets, managing dispute resolution), stakeholder relations (e.g. managing unions), to expansion into new markets (e.g. navigating local laws). In this regard, this course is designed to impart to you an understanding of the employment law regime in Singapore. You will acquire an awareness of the employment landscape and key employment-related laws in Singapore. You will learn to identify and address key issues that impact employment and affect employment relationships. You will develop a working understanding of the key ‘buckets’ of employment law, from hiring, managing, terminating, to post-termination matters. You will develop an appreciation of how these legal requirements not only apply to daily operational issues, but also how they form the crucial basis for higher-level strategic management decisions. You will hence study requirements and issues relating to the following non-exhaustive list of topics: • Hiring employees, including looking at fair hiring guidelines on non-discriminatory and ‘locals-first’ policies in Singapore; and hiring of foreign manpower; • Managing employees, including looking at employers’ and employees’ rights and obligations under law; employment contracts, including what they comprise and how they govern an employment relationship; and workplace safety and health matters, an area under significant scrutiny following COVID-19; • Terminating employees, including whether and how employees can be dismissed from the workplace; how retrenchment exercises work; and the respective pitfalls; • Industrial relations, including how they affect the hiring, managing and termination phases of the employment relationship; and • Post-termination concerns, including confidentiality and non-competition/solicitation obligations. Through the course, you will be exposed to the different sources of employment law, including legislation, case law, tripartite guidelines, advisories issued by the Ministry of Manpower, amongst others. You will understand how the tripartite relationship between the Government, employers and unions work and affect these. In this respect, this is a very grounded course, which will require you to develop a clear understanding of the employment legal regime and then think practically on how to anticipate, manage, and navigate employment issues, as well as apply them to broader organizational objectives. This course will be especially pertinent to students aspiring to careers as a HR professional or in management. In either role, a firm grasp of employment law means that you will be able to proactively identify and flag potential issues, hence becoming a valued strategic partner to your employer. The course will also be relevant to students who are interested in consulting work or business in general.",

      "Power, status, and influence are topics that make many people a little uncomfortable. However, power is a fundamental reality in much (maybe all) of organizational and social life. Power and influence are key mechanisms by which things get done. This course is designed so that you will learn concepts useful for understanding power and influence, and ways of analyzing power dynamics in organizations. Even more importantly, the course encourages you to think about and develop your own personal path to power (which can include, of course, a path away from power), as well as to develop your skills in exercising power and influence—to make you more comfortable with “managing with power.” The course will also introduce difficult ethical questions associated with the use of power and influence, and challenge you to define for yourself what constitutes the ethical exercise of power and influence in your life. The materials and ideas that form the basis for much of the course have been selected because they challenge many aspects of conventional wisdom or the taken-for-granted assumptions that many people hold about the sources of success and influence. The ideas and concepts are, however, well grounded in empirical literature in the behavioral and social sciences. If some of the readings or discussions disagree with your ideas or cause you to feel uncomfortable, that discomfort is part and parcel of the learning process.",

    description: `As the world becomes more globalized many companies achieve competitive advantage by paying substantial attention on effective supply chain operations. Warehouses are consolidation hubs of various products in a supply chain. To support business that covers a wide range of markets it is common for a warehouse to store hundreds of thousands of products. These products pass through the warehouse in huge volume daily, and so it is important to run it efficiently.

Besides the traditional storage function, warehouses are increasingly forced to perform responsive and accurate customer order fulfillment and other value-added services. High performance in product warehousing and order fulfillment becomes crucial to the success of many companies in today's competitive business environment. We will introduce various operation models that are theoretically appealing and practically feasible. Some case studies will also be discussed.

      "This course introduces the core topics and major issues in American politics. Students will develop the toolkit needed to understand American political institutions such as Congress, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court, and provide social scientific theories which describe how these institutions function. The course will then examine organizations that mediate the relationship between political institutions and the American public, such as parties and interest groups, and study how these organizations engage with the American public through polling and campaigns. We will conclude with a focus on contemporary political challenges in American politics such as race, inequality, polarization, and foreign policy, which, in turn, we will use to analyse the rise of President Donald Trump.",
