      "The purpose of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of statistics through illustrative use of statistical methods for solving applied problems. Emphasis will be placed on statistical reasoning, rather than derivation of theoretical details. Students will learn to solve common statistical problems using statistical software. This course is designed for students who wish to pursue a non-quantitative major at SMU. Students who intend to pursue a quantitative major should take its companion course, COR-STAT1203 Introduction to Statistical Theory.",

      "Computational Thinking equips students to tackle complex computational problems; it trains students to design solutions to solve those problems using a computer program. It draws upon concepts from mathematics and computer science – more precisely, discrete mathematics, data structures and algorithm design. This course will hone students’ analytical skills as they are challenged to think abstractly and computationally. Their minds will be open to the wonders of computing, as they go behind the scene to unravel the fundamental analytics that empower Google, consulting agencies and service companies. NOTE: To facilitate learning in this course, you are required to know and use programming. You are advised to pick up the Python programming language before the course, for instance by practising with online tutorials such as http://learnpython.org. By taking this course, students will: • discover the science of computing • model problems and learn practical problem-solving techniques to tackle complex computational problems (beyond what a spreadsheet is capable of solving) • apply problem-solving techniques to develop more elegant and efficient programs • learn to write programs to represent and manipulate with complex data objects • understand the challenge of scale, not only in dealing with large data sets, but also in appreciating the nature of computing and computability",

    description:
      "You give reasons for what you do and think every day. You argue. You often argue about things that matter to you. For example you might argue that you are the best candidate for promotion, about whether your company should invest in China, about the best way to help a friend or about what the right thing to do is in an ethical dilemma. The list is up to you. Increasingly in the 21st job market, you will need to think straight about any issue, even those unfamiliar to you. Recent surveys indicate that the most important skills employers are looking for are critical thinking and problem solving skills. We will teach you how to get better at reasoning and arguing in a way that can be applied to any subject matter.\n                Topics covered include evaluating arguments, constructing arguments, reconstructing arguments, formalizing arguments, clarifying meaning and identifying common mistakes in argument (fallacies). At the end of the course you should be able to (1) identify the structures of real-life arguments in order to decide if they are good or bad, and (2) argue logically about things that matter to you. This course is specifically designed to improve writing, thinking and oral presentation skills that are applicable to all areas of academic study and relevant to working life. Careful application in this course will deepen your capacity to critically evaluate everyday practical scenarios and will help you ‘think outside the box’.",

    description:
      "\n            The dynamic and fast changing nature of our world today is best described by VUCA, a term coined by the US Army War College. VUCA stands for Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous. The Arab Spring saw a change of government in countries like Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. Once powerful countries in Europe are now fighting bankruptcy. The growth of the developing world which was taken for granted has begun to slow down. Even companies that were synonymous with their product categories just a few years ago are now no longer in existence. Kodak, the inventor of the digital camera had to wind up its operations, Borders, once the second largest US bookstore, has shut down due to their inability to evolve their business models with the changing times.\n\n            With such momentous changes happening in the world today, this course prepares the students to better understand the complexity and difficulties in reacting to the ambiguity inherent in those changes. This course helps students to understand the tensions in a given situation and how they need to think through a problem from multiple dimensions.\n\n            The course aims to give students an insight into the mega trends and forces that are impacting their world. We ask what are some of the causes of these trends and their business implications? What can future managers like themselves do about understanding these changing trends, and why they need to address, appreciate, adapt and attempt to manage these changes in their ecosystem? The course aims to introduce some basic VUCA concepts, in order to broaden their world view of management and nature of managing complex problems. The first half of the course introduces some of these trends, while the second half provides tools and possible frameworks to deal with the VUCA aspects that they will face in the future.",

The primary theoretical perspective taken is the stakeholder view of the firm which allows for close examination of apparently conflicting goals between different stakeholders' interests. Related frameworks and applications discussed in this course include corporate social responsibility, globalization, corporate governance, and public policy measures affecting business. The frameworks and issues discussed are critical to understanding how firms can be both financially successful and valuable to society, a concern which is increasingly influencing managerial decision-making. Illustrations and applications to the Singapore context as a small open economy will be discussed.",

    description:
      "Data Science has become one of the main drivers in transforming businesses and organizations. With proper data collection, preparation, analysis and modelling, insights can be achieved leading to better decision making and actions that create positive impact. Data analytics is divided into different levels namely, descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics and automated (or embedded) analytics. In this course, students will acquire practical skills in modelling and analysis to resolve business problems using software tools including Excel and Tableau. Knowing how to effectively use these tools to build models and analyse data to solve problems will add tremendous value in our students’ future professional career. This course’s primary focus is on using Excel spreadsheet as a platform to build mathematical models from scratch to represent business problems for detailed analysis. The use of such models to drive understanding and consensus towards generating insights and actions enhanced the assurance of execution success. With the data collected, data manipulation and transformation will be needed to prepare the data into useful forms for analysis. In terms of data analytics, this course will cover descriptive analytics, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics, using both Excel and Tableau. In-class exercises would be used to present business problem modeling and analysis. Students would interactively develop the skills and experience to deal with open-ended questions, unclear assumptions and incomplete information. In addition to the individual assessments (take-home assignments and in-class quizzes), a group project will allow students to apply the knowledge and skills acquired to solve a business problem of their choice end-to-end where they will define the business questions, collect the necessary data, build the models, perform the data analytics, to draw insights and conclusions.",

      "\n            The overall objective of this module is to build and develop students' competency in leadership and teamwork skills. The course employs both a theoretical and an experiential learning approach with the aim of fulfilling the objectives as outlined below.\n\n            Students will gain knowledge and skills about leadership development and team-building skills based on theories, principles, concepts, application, exercises/class activities, self-assessments/instruments, and experiential learning.\n\n            Central to the course is the action-based and experiential Group Project Assignment that offers an opportunity for students to work in groups to collaborate with a non-profit organization or profit-based organization that upholds community development and/or corporate social responsibility or sustainability initiatives1, that is, they initiate and act as idea champions to contribute to community with a project of their own and approach beneficiaries along the way to amend or improve on their ideas. Students are also free to work with any profit and/or non-profit organization on an existing or new project they may have, provided such opportunities exist and are offered to students.\n\n            As idea champions, students work in groups, to develop/invent a prototype/model or mobile application or put into place a process, program or plan such as a business plan that will value-add and contribute to the needs of the beneficiary or organization of their choice. It is entirely up to the leadership of the organization concerned whether they would consider implementing or not implementing what students have designed. In other words, there is no compulsion for any organization to eventually sponsor the proposed ideas to the organization(s) concerned or may be collaborating with.\n\n            The outcomes of the group project for students are outlined as follows:\n            (i) Students will learn about leadership from the leaders they are connecting with. For example, they will learn how and why today's leaders are engaged in community-based or social initiatives in Singapore and beyond.\n            (ii) Students will also learn from the leaders lessons on leadership and/or teamwork based on the leaders' experiences.\n            (iii) By undertaking a hands-on group project, students will also learn practical lessons as well as the complexities of teamwork based on their OWN experience and process of working internally, with their group mates and externally, with organizations outside of school.\n            (iv) Each student will also reflect on his/her own learning throughout the project from start to end as outlined below (see 'Reflection Essay' for details).\n            (v) Students will also fulfill other learning objectives that include cognitive and academic development as outlined below in the section, 'Learning Objectives'",

      "The core objective of the new SMU-X Transformative Leadership course is to nurture a new generation of young leaders motivated and capable of tackling intricate global and local challenges related to the nexus of ‘digital disruption, demographic change and diversity’ in an integrated, interdisciplinary fashion, providing the opportunity to integrate perceived differences between older and younger people in terms of values, communication priorities; age discrimination or the initiation of new types of social (‘digital’) behaviours transmitted from the plugged-in ‘Generation Z’ (born 1996 and after) to Baby Boomers (born 1946 to 1964). These three challenges (positioned at the interface of both current and future issues) are not only globally relevant but also have significant local implications for Singapore. Embedded in the experiential SMU-X initiative, the Transformative Leadership course provides students with a unique learning opportunity to develop and implement (socially) innovative solutions to make a positive impact on business and society in close collaboration with reputable partners in business, nonprofits and government. Learners will be paired up with an external SMU-X partner to work on relevant innovative projects with real impact. The successful completion of such transformative SMU-X projects requires learners diving deep(er) into various disciplines such as social sciences, business, political governance, public policy, demography, technology, etc. It is expected that the chosen practical challenges commissioned by SMU-X partners will ‘stretch’ students, forcing them to step out of their comfort zones and to explore the unknowns in order to make a ‘real’ difference ‘out there’ in both the social and business sectors. In terms of effective leader development, in particular, transformative leadership, the SMU-X course design will support learners in expanding their individual capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes. Emphasis will be put on proximal indicators of leader development such as self-views around self-concept, including leader self-awareness, leadership self-efficacy and leader. Through their SMU-X projects, students will appreciate the importance of leadership development so that they can articulate what it takes for teams and their leaders to create strong(er) alignment and high(er) levels of commitment. The latter requires interpersonal trust, care and concern as well as shared mind-sets regarding (transformative) goals and values such as the ‘real’ sharing propelled by collaborative leadership approaches.",

Today's policy problems are described as ‘wicked problems’ that lack a set of clear definitions, causes and effects, and solutions. The wicked nature of the policy problems requires considering the perspectives of multiple stakeholders and innovative policy solutions. This course explores how governments and their stakeholders have experimented with new ideas, policies, governing processes, institutional arrangements, management tools, and technologies, to create public value and effect positive change. Using cases studies from a variety of policy areas and different countries, the course encourages students to understand the opportunities and challenges of public sector change initiatives including collaborative governance, e-governance, and coproduction.

It also considers the technological transformations that enabled and facilitated global imperial expansion. In so doing it considers imperialism’s role in environmental change in Asia; the transposition of scientific thought between West and East and, the evolution of environmentalism as a movement.

Through in-class seminars incorporating digital platforms and field trips, students will examine the basic science underpinning present knowledge of climate change; explore the impacts of rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and rising sea levels on society; and discuss the role of technology and its management towards climate change adaptation and mitigation solutions and policies. Case studies from Singapore and the region will be presented, and special attention focused towards the latest research on (i.) socio-economic inequalities that heighten risks towards urban populations, and (ii.) how technological innovation evolves with applied nature-based solutions in reducing climate vulnerabilities. By the end of the course, the student should be cognisant on the potential of effective and practical management in reducing the impacts of environmental hazards to coupled human-environmental systems, and have the ability to assess solutions to adapt to and mitigate climate change impacts on important industries. Climate change will continue to wreck devastating social and economic impact in the years to come. The ability to understand and devise effective solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change across industries will be a valuable core skill enabling SMU graduates to maintain agility as they progress in their careers.",

    description:
      'The newest development in machine learning methods, such as Deep Neural Networks, brought about ubiquitous proclamations of a radical societal change. Amidst utopian visions of technological enthusiasts and dystopian scenarios advanced by the sceptics that proliferate in media, some basic questions about the aims and the tools of AI remain obscured. "Can Machines think ?” This class takes one of the central questions addressed to and by the proponents of the AI, artists, and philosophers as an entry point to consider the current emphasis on the transformative potential of machine learning from a historical perspective. Therefore, the course structure is mostly chronological. We will situate the field of AI in the long tradition of automata construction, as well as in the context of a cold war meta-discipline of cybernetics. We will read the original works of the founders of the field, such as Alan Turing and John McCarthy, to reconstruct the main lines of the intellectual development of the field as well as its paradoxes. We will also overview some of the main philosophical and ethical debates around the notions of “intelligence," “rationality," and “mind” in light of the computational technics for decision making. Finally, the course materials include a selection of science fiction novels, films, and short stories in order to discuss the notion of technological imagination as a link connecting public science, cultural production, and the formation of a scientific/engineering research programs.',

    description:
      "This course is a response to the increasing use of robotics, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and digital technologies in business and society. Drones are unmanned, multi-purpose tools. Their history can be traced back to World War I when the US army experimented with unmanned aerial torpedos. Nowadays, drone technology belongs to the military arsenal of many nations. Drones serve many purposes (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance etc.), and they can be deadly. In business and society, drones are utilised to capture images of people and/or buildings, to monitor agricultural conditions, to take pictures from (or of) hard to reach places, to assess the impact of climate change on rainforests, to film events, to deliver parcels, to survey real estate, to deliver help to heart attack victims in remote areas via a flying defibrillator or to fly life-saving kits to swimmers in emergency situations. In view of their increasing importance in terms of commercial value creation, R&D (it is estimated that about $6.4 billion is spent annually for R&D on drones), job creation, innovation (e.g. Internet of Things), new forms of warfare as well as legal/moral-ethical/regulatory concerns, it is imperative that students learn to critically appreciate the multiple and often conflicting implications and consequences of this technology for business and society. To achieve that, students will have to read widely and familiarize themselves with the various functionalities of robotics, UAVs and digital innovations in order to critically assess these technologies and to articulate informed opinions about ‘the good’, ‘the bad’, and ‘the future’ of these novel technological developments. The course will be taught by a multi-disciplinary team of instructors plus exposure to tech entrepreneurs and digital (corporate) innovation champions.",

Some biotechnological companies like 23andMe promise clients access to their ancient ancestry with a simple DNA swab. Scientists have harnessed the power of cloning that promises miraculous cures through stem cell therapies. Many patients have pinned their hopes in the secrets of the BRCA genes to find that elusive cure for breast cancer. But what is biotechnology? How did the field emerge and for what purpose? What are the potentials and dangers of this new field? Who actually benefits from new biotechnologies? This course will explore these questions by examining the modern history of biotechnology and its embedding in a global, capitalist society. We will trace the political ideals, scientific developments, technological infrastructures, and new economic modes that made biotechnology possible.",

This course will consider several interrelated issues connected to climate change. Such issues include: What ethical challenges does climate change raise? Who has a right to what emission levels? How do we negotiate between collective and individual self-interests? What would constitute a just allocation of the burdens of climate change? What can economic analysis tell us (and not tell us) about climate change? In what ways does uncertainty challenge our ability to understand what we should do about climate change? Why might geoengineering be morally problematic? What are we individually and collectively required to do about climate change? What are our responsibilities toward future generations and the environment, and how do we take these into account? This course will examine the science, and look closely at the interplay of science and public policy. It will also look at the role of values in science. This course will approach these issues from a variety of perspectives.

      "The notion that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capacity to transform the way society operates has long been a part of popular culture. Androids have been dreaming of electric sheep since 1968, and Tom Cruise was already arresting pre-criminals in 2002. With the explosion of data available to governments and companies, and cloud computing platforms making supercomputing power widely available, science fiction and reality have never been closer. However, the true capabilities and limitations of AI are often poorly understood, as some predict doom, while others promise the moon. Modern AI techniques have the capacity to improve the way organisations operate, improving decision-making and increasing human and environmental wellbeing, but also carry the potential to cause harm if used irresponsibly or ignorantly. Accessible to technical and non-technical students alike, this course will introduce you to key techniques, showing how they can be flexibly applied to a range of problems, from using game theory to intercept wildlife poachers, through machine learning models for crime prediction, to risk-aware logistics scheduling. The course will guide you through the ethical implications of AI, considering the effects of biased data and the uncritical application of techniques. By the end of the course you will have a working understanding of the capacities and limitations of practical AI, equipping you to critically analyse new developments, and engage in responsible, informed decision-making in the workplace.",

More than that, constitutions express a state’s identity and provide the framework for all other laws and policies. This course will expose students to the challenges attendant on making constitutions work. At the same time, it will sensitise them to the extent to which the wider social, political and economic context and a country’s underlying culture affect the implementation of constitutional rules and values. Evergreens like the separation of powers, constitutional enforcement and dilemmas in ensuring equality and dignity will be explored through comparative study of experiences in a diverse range of jurisdictions. Instead of exploring models and constitutional solutions in the abstract, the course invites students to explore the practical impact and outcomes particular constitutional models and ideas produce in everyday life. To that end, we will amongst others compare the constitutional responses that different countries provide to contemporary challenges such as how to ensure effective public participation in governance without encouraging populism; the pervasiveness of migration for our understanding of citizenship and its entitlements; ensuring that everyone is treated equally while respecting individual autonomy and life choices; the role of technology in public life and the implications for privacy and free speech; and the role of a constitution in fostering economic development.",

      "Cultural history brings to life past epochs and places. In this pursuit, it analyses beliefs and ideas, products of artistic nature, as well as the objects and experiences of everyday life, such as clothing or cuisine. Culture also encompasses attitudes, values, assumptions and prejudices, and the rituals and practices that express them. In this regard, our current thoughts and acts have an ancestry which cultural history can illuminate and critically examine. This course explores fundamental moments in the history of Europe: from the foundations in Greece and Rome, through the alliances, conflicts and revolutions that transformed it, and key periods such as the Enlightenment and Modernism, that significantly shaped it. They all help understand the complexities of today's Europe, from the challenges in cultural integration to Brexit. Through lectures, key readings, analyses of case studies and research projects, this course broadens understanding of Europe. By establishing linkages between history, socio-political and economic contexts, religion, and art forms, it reveals crucial intersections to comprehend the landmarks of the cultural history of Europe.",

      "Nations have long sought to evoke loyalty and personal attachment, while in turn providing those living within it with a collective experience and common destiny. The potent force of the nation as a cognitive idea is at the heart of this course, which conceives of the making of a nation as an ongoing work in progress in which everyone has a stake. The central question that we will investigate concerns the reciprocal influences between the nation, its institutional manifestations and ‘the people’. How do ‘the people’ shape institutions and fashion a nation on a daily basis and vice versa?\n\n                To explore these relationships, the course is structured around three themes: prerequisites, process and practice. The first theme provides the general conceptual framework through a series of brief discussions of what a nation is, how it relates to a state and to a ‘people’. The second theme is devoted to what is often seen as the quintessential nation-building moment: the formal drafting of a constitution. We will consider the choice of language in that text to harness the people’s fidelity to the budding nation as well as the respective roles played by the elites and ordinary citizens during the constitution-process. For the third theme, we will probe the lived reality of how the nation constitutes itself every day through its people, from the elites who claim to speak on behalf of the nation in formal rule-making to the personification of the nation in image, song and icon to the architectural design of state institutions and public spaces and the wearing of folk costumes or traditional outfits that seek to give expression to the identity of the nation.\n\n                Our explorations will feature the experiences of a diverse range of nations located within and outside Asia. These will provide the backdrop against which the Singapore story will be considered, thereby allowing students to interrogate the familiar domestic narrative of nation-building from a comparative angle. The approach taken will be practically grounded and interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from law, political theory, history, linguistics, architecture and the arts. To do so effectively, the course will be team-taught by two instructors with complementary disciplinary backgrounds.\n                ",

First, we will briefly explore the history of film in the region and discuss various methods of reading films as texts. Second, we will critically examine what Southeast Asian films reveal about colonialism, decolonization and nation building, Cold War, and globalization in the region. Next, we will explore contemporary topics and issues in Southeast Asia such as religion and violence, gender, race, class, development, and globalization. Finally, we will assess the contemporary role and significance of films against the rapid technological disruptions taking place within Southeast Asian and beyond.",

In this course, we explore the big question of whether these two concepts – the global and the local – are really opposites and whether it is possible to find a home in a world that is global. These explorations will transpire through analysis and discussion of readings drawn from business, scientific, legal, philosophical, and aesthetic sources illuminating the intersections of the global and local. By the end of the course, students will be expected to able to articulate their responses to whether they can find home in a globalized world by integrating the course material with their own personal experiences.

We will cover major theoretical perspectives that social scientists of different disciplines have used to guide their study of globalization. Although globalization often seems like a set of chaotic events, these theoretical perspectives shed light on the systematic and institutionalized nature of global processes. We will discuss issues in global politics, society, and culture where we will examine the role of the nation-state, global human rights, social movements, and questions of national culture and identity. We will also explore issues in the global economy and questions of global economic governance, where will examine the consequences of global institutions and economic globalization. Throughout the course, we emphasize the core question of global governance.\n\n        This course prepares students for informed citizenship in a rapidly globalizing world. Many students will go on to find employment in organizations in which decisions made can have profound global consequences. As such, students will be equipped with the necessary conceptual and empirical knowledge to evaluate debates on globalization and to critique the roles that state and non-state actors play in global processes. Students will be trained to discern the positive and negative impacts of key actors that are involved in global governance.

    description:
      "Law and legal systems are ubiquitous in modern societies. As Kant noted, law takes away man’s “savage (lawless) freedom” to return to him a more limited freedom under the law. But what exactly is law? How is law related to justice? Is law merely a power phenomenon? Is law merely politics? Is the monopolization of coercive force by the state justified?\n\n                This course provides students with the opportunity to think about law’s nature and its role in society. We will examine these questions through accounts of law offered by legal positivists and natural law theorists, and challenges posed by alternative critical accounts of American legal realism and critical legal studies. How do modern and critical accounts of law shape our thinking about the nature and purpose of law? Are the accounts rooted in particular historical contexts or cultures, or are they as relevant today or within our society? How does adopting a particular account of law impact the present practice of law? Do the accounts have something to say about how we, as lawyers or citizenry, can harness law’s potential as a tool for transforming society?\n\n                Through this course, students will have a unique opportunity to engage their hearts and minds in relation to the concepts of law and justice. Students will also be encouraged to relate the theories studied to current contexts. The course's focus is on critique of ideas and not mere description of doctrine. The methods of assessment will be intentionally geared towards facilitating critical thought. This course encourages students to formulate their own theses about law and justice, and meaningfully understand the role they can play – as lawyers and as citizens – in the legal process.",

      "Humans have been making war and peace throughout their recorded history. We can be fairly certain this was the case well before civilization emerged. Conflicts always seem to erupt over scarce resources, contentious values and ideas, fissures in relationships, fault-lines in societies, the list goes on. And, intertwined with these conflicts are efforts to end violence, to heal wounds and reconcile, to share resources, to create or re-establish a semblance of harmony between peoples. Most of all will perceive these human activities as binary opposites, as mutually exclusive, leading us to invest particular meanings in each to distinguish them further from each other. Indeed, thanks to influences from culture, media, from our communities, families and leaders, we typically perceive war and peace as suffering versus happiness, action not stillness, a zone of masculine combat versus one of safety for women and children, and much more. These ingrained perceptions shape our decisions, actions and relationships in fundamental ways, determining our behavior and experiences in all spaces and times, whether we have construed them to be in the context of war, peace, and anything beyond or in-between. Since our views of war and peace are so fundamental to our life experience, this course asks us for a deeper engagement of our prior knowledge.\n                    Through critical engagement with a variety of disciplines and empirical contexts, we will consider the intertwined phenomena of war and peace in theory and praxis. The course explores the value systems we attach to each, why, and with what consequences for ourselves and others? We investigate how our notions of war and peace contribute directly to the construction of our identity as well as ideas about belonging, power, justice, progress, and more. In so doing, we look into the ways people, their customs, laws and culture respond to their perceptions and experiences of war and peace; reflect on how they debate the purposes of war-making and peace-making; and discuss how they compete and cooperate for the spoils of both war and peace. Also, we will study how our knowledge of war and peace may continually change over time. By the end of the course, students will have an expansive understanding of how these two phenomena come together in ways that structure and define their everyday lives.",

      "In this course, we introduce students to the economic way of thinking about societal issues. We use the themes of incentives and empiricism to illustrate the power of simple economic ideas, and their ability to explain, predict, and improve what happens in the world. The course will examine how market activities are shaped by both the private and public sector. It will allow students to appreciate how free markets and government policies affect society, creating winners and losers, and to understand the societal trade-offs implicated in an economy. The course will also examine debates on the importance of social institutions in contributing to economic growth, and on economic policies surrounding the world financial crisis. Two topics related to Growth in Asia will be covered in the course.",

Big Questions will introduce students to the challenging ethical, theoretical, and operational debates that attend to these themes. Students in any given year will be able to choose from a menu of sub-themes, each using a different disciplinary lens and focusing on different aspects of the theme, while also sharing a canon of readings and attending public lectures dedicated to the year's theme for a shared intellectual experience. The themes may include Happiness and Suffering, Global and Local, Robots and Humans, Wealth and Poverty, War and Peace, amongst others.",

      "The objective of the Course is to raise the awareness of students with regard to the multi-faceted ethical and social responsibility issues faced by businesses and corporate executives, whether individuals or organisations. The initial part of the Course will focus on critiquing various ethical and social theories developed by philosophers, economists, sociologists, management theorists and others. Both Western and non-Western theories will be examined. The Course also aims at developing the moral reasoning skills of students and applying them to the specific problems and dilemmas faced by individuals and organisations in the business and corporate world.",

      "We begin our adventure by exploring the essential elements of Computing Systems — hardware, software, and network technologies — through a series of challenging yet fun learning activities. We grow our coding skills by building a networked, distributed computing system: starting with physical computing devices that unite the cyber and physical realms, we add fundamental networking capabilities for devices to exchange information and form networks, and finally integrate the system into the cloud. Equipped with newfound skills and knowledge, we unleash our creative energies, our youthful idealism, and our capacity to dream, by designing visionary technology to conquer a real-world societal challenge. This is a journey into the unknown. Yet, a still, small voice deep within us compels us: Courage! Do not be afraid! Put out into the deepest oceans and brave the stormiest seas! Let down your nets for an awesome catch! The adventure reaches its peak at the project showcase, where we witness the work of human hands come to fruition, leaving us inspired to reflect deeply and broadly about how we, as global citizens, can harness the power of Computing Systems as a potent force in the service of humanity.",

      "Web applications are commonly used today by governments, enterprises, and even individuals to provide information, market products, etc. Ability to create web applications is thus a crucial skill for graduates in Information Systems. This course is designed to equip students with the knowledge and skill to develop well-styled database-driven web applications. In the early weeks of the course, students would be introduced to web concepts and trained to build static web pages using HTML. Next, students will be taught on how to program dynamic web applications using PHP. Programming concepts that students have learned in Introduction to Programming (IS111) will be revisited (using PHP as the programming language), expanded, and used to allow students to program web applications that can adapt based on user inputs. After basic PHP programming has been introduced, students will then be taught on how they can connect to a database to store, retrieve, modify, and delete data. They can then design dynamic web pages that present different contents reflecting contents stored in a database as well as allow users to modify database contents through the webpages. In the final weeks of the course, students will be introduced to more advanced PHP concepts including session management to allow for stateful interactive information exchange between users and a web application.",

      "This course is designed to equip students with knowledge and skills to develop well-styled and responsive web applications that provide rich user experiences. Combining with the skills learnt in IS113 course, which focuses on developing database-driven web applications with basic web designs, after this course, the students will be equipped with full stack web development skills, who can build both front-end and back-end software. In the introductory weeks of the course, the students will revisit HTML and server-side programming (PHP) concepts learnt in IS113. Then, the students will learn the concept of “Styling” the web pages. The students will learn a style sheet language called cascading style sheets (CSS) and learn how to separate the content and presentation of web pages, how to control web page layout, colors and fonts, how to bring multiple styles into a web page, how to control the layout of multiple web pages efficiently, etc. Next, the students will learn the concept of adding responsive behaviors to web pages to enhance the user experience. The students will learn a client-side programming language called JavaScript to make ordinary web elements like input boxes, buttons, forms, tables, menus interactive and animated. Furthermore, they will learn how to connect to API gateways and process data from external sources like RESTful web services so that they can build practical applications. In the latter weeks of the course, the students will be introduced to programming with frameworks. The students will learn how to use frameworks to build complex web applications in an efficient, scalable manner. More specifically, the students will be introduced to Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework for developing responsive website and introduced to Vue, a progressive JavaScript framework for building rich user interfaces.",

      "With the emergence of new technologies and evolution of existing ones, organizations are changing the way they build enterprise solutions. Rather than build monolithic applications, the current emphasis is on building solutions by leveraging existing functionality exposed as services. This approach to composing solutions using services follows the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) paradigm, where applications are structured as a collection of loosely coupled services. In this course students will learn how to design and implement enterprise solutions using SOA using suitable tools. The course will cover topics such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), microservices architecture (MSA), web services, JSON/XML, cloud computing, and Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).",

It provides strong and reliable support for all kinds of information systems in various industries. It also greatly reduces the go-to-market time for high-tech start-up companies. Although many people are using cloud in their daily work, but few of them have structural understanding on how cloud functions. With more and more fancy features incorporated in Cloud, it seems difficult for beginners to understand their relations and apply them to real world problems. This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concept and basic structure of cloud computing. The topics covered include basic cloud concept, typical business and technical requirements on cloud infrastructure, basic building blocks for an cloud solution, and how to manage reliability and incident using cloud tools. All topics are designed based on actual commercial usage pattern to support real business requirements. Computing theory and mathematical analysis are included at a minimally needed level. Exercising and integration of knowledge learnt will be covered through assignments, labs, and a demonstrative project for real world problems. After this course, students are expected to gain a structural concept of how cloud operates and how to manipulate cloud resources to support information system and business needs. The principles and techniques learnt in this course will help students understand the common core structure of various commercial cloud platforms and how to go deeper to a specific function. With this foundation, students can easily build up their knowledge of a chosen commercial cloud on a systematic way using online resources.",

      "In Technology and World Change, we show our students how technology has changed and continues to change the lives of people and society. We study the processes by which technology and modern society have co-evolved, especially how the past provides insights on potential changes in the future. We study specific examples of how technological innovations have been created, refined and implemented by entrepreneurs, larger corporations or industrial systems. This course trains students to think critically in a broad-based, interdisciplinary manner, and to analyse matters of potential uncertainty and ambiguity. After this course, students should be more perceptive to opportunities for innovations and technological change, regardless of the industry they will be in.",

Sustainability in cities, particularly in the context of environmental and climate change.\n\n                2. The role of technology in enhancing and disrupting “normal” ways of life in the city, through the use of shared riding/food delivery apps, and social media.\n\n                3. How technology applied judiciously can enhance livability and livelihoods for a wide range of urban residents who are both technology-savvy and residents uncomfortable using technology.\n\n                \n                Students will gain an understanding of how selected industries consider and apply these technologies towards urban sustainability issues. While there will be some in-class meetings to discuss theoretical concepts, learning will be primarily experiential in nature through class discussion, group exercises, and a team project. Guest speakers with practical and industrial experience may be invited as well. The course project will work with one or two industry sponsors. Students are expected to conceive a solution to address a defined problem statement, related to an aspect of urban sustainability with societal impact, and in accordance to the real-world needs of the industry sponsor.",

Project selections do not need to be unique, meaning multiple teams can select the same project idea. Each student project team will be assigned to a sponsor and an SMU faculty supervisor.  Sponsors will provide project scope and management for student teams to have practical industry learning experiences.  Student teams will have weekly check in meetings, either virtually or physically, with their sponsor. Student project teams will be expected to develop a working software application prototype, to be delivered to the sponsor at the end of the course.  Sponsors will specify the technologies to be used, including; development tools/languages, OS, database, 3rd party libraries, target deployment environment e.g. cloud environment.

Students will learn: The different paradigms of algorithm design such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. The analysis on the complexity of algorithms. Limits of algorithm design via the study of intractability including the reductions of given problems to known problems and the knowledge of NP completeness and NP hardness. More modern algorithm design concepts such as approximation to achieve more effective problem solving and more efficient solutions. This course will go into the theoretical underpinnings of efficiency, algorithm correctness, and how algorithm design has a basis in identifying mathematical properties of the problem.",

      "With the advancement of systems like GPT, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are anticipated to significantly impact various aspects of individuals' lives. While these AI techniques have demonstrated remarkable, occasionally superhuman, performance across numerous applications, there is a growing concern regarding their safety and security. It has been shown AI systems are subject to a range of attacks, ranging from adversarial attacks (i.e., perturbing an input slightly causes an AI to make completely wrong predictions), backdoor attacks (i.e., backdoors can be easily embedded in neural networks), and privacy-violating attacks such as membership inference attacks (i.e., an adversary may reliably infer whether a certain sample is used during training or not). In addition, AI systems can inherit or amplify biases present in their training data, potentially leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Furthermore, many AI models, including GPT, are complex and not easily interpretable. It makes understanding how these models make decisions highly nontrivial, even though it is crucial for trust and accountability. This course aims to present a systematic view on the range of AI safety problems that have been identified, analyse their root causes, and study potential approaches to mitigate the safety and security risks. In particular, we will focus on answering two key questions. First, given an AI system, how do we systematically evaluate its safety risk? Second, given an AI system that potentially has safety issues, how do we systematically mitigate the risks? This course will feature real-life AI safety issues on popular AI systems such as ImageNet, GPT and so on.",

In particular, some topics such as Bayesian inference, is crucial to AI-related courses (CS420, CS421, CS422, CS424, CS425). Thus, the course will require not only the understanding and development of some theoretical results with mathematical rigour, but also hands-on programming skills for practical applications. Knowledge in basic calculus is required. Some concepts in discrete mathematics (CS104) are useful, such as counting, sets and functions. While the course will use Python and its packages to illustrate and practice class work, prior knowledge of Python is not required. However, previous experience in any programming language such as C/C++ and Java is expected.  Good programming etiquettes such as code readability, reusability, efficiency and reproducibility are also expected at a level adequate for most computer science courses.",

    description: `Machine Learning is one of the fundamental subjects in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience (e.g., learning to recognize images, classify text documents, detect fraudulent credit card transactions, or drive autonomous vehicles). This course covers both fundamental principles and practical algorithms for machine learning. It includes in-depth introduction of the techniques and algorithms in two major machine learning paradigms – supervised learning and unsupervised learning. For supervised learning, it covers both linear and non-linear models for two supervised tasks: classification and regression. For unsupervised learning, it covers three major unsupervised tasks: clustering, dimension reduction, and anomaly detection. The course also includes deep learning approaches for each of the aforementioned five tasks, highlighting the principles of making different “shallow” models “deeper”.
      The course is intended to prepare students for a good understanding of principles, challenges, and opportunities in ML. It aims to equip students with the capability of applying machine learning techniques to address real-world applications and building the foundations of doing research in machine learning. To this end, the course highlights the following five key features:
      ·   	Systematic treatment of ML techniques. It covers shallow and deep algorithms and techniques for five popular ML tasks.
      ·   	Understanding of commonly used mathematical foundations in ML. The course introduces principled mathematical foundations behind diverse ML techniques, such as least squares optimization, Lp regularization, maximum likelihood estimation, gradient descent optimization, and backpropagation.
      ·   	Introduction to emerging topics and current ML challenges. The course includes an overview of emerging topics including semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, and interpretability, security, privacy, and safety in ML.
      ·   	Progressive ML model development. CS421 includes a Kaggle-competition-style group project to shape the capability of developing effective models to address a real problem with data progressively made available.
      ·   	Model implementation. One assignment and diverse lab sessions are designed to support the development of capability in implementing different ML models using existing libraries.
      It is a course recommended for those who have some ML experience/skill and want to achieve a more systematic and comprehensive understanding of ML, as well as for beginners who are not familiar with ML but have very strong curiosity to explore. Extensive coding is expected for this course.
      Students are strongly encouraged to have proficiency in IS103 Computational Thinking prior to reading this course.
      NOTE: While this is an introduction course, it is a technical course and it is highly recommended that students are proficient in programming, probability, statistics and linear algebra (e.g., CS103 Linear Algebra for Computing Applications, CS105 Statistical Thinking for Data Science, CS201 Data Structures and Algorithms and CS202 Design and Analysis of Algorithms).

      "Search and optimization are the fundamental building blocks of AI. Almost all problems in AI (including machine learning) involve some sort of search or optimization. This course will cover the basics of search and optimization. Broadly, the course will be split along two axes: one is discrete vs continuous optimization, and another is heuristic methods vs exact techniques. The applications of the topics covered in class is immediate, for example, shortest path problems are used by all mapping services such as Google Maps. Travelling salesman problems are used to design routes for parcel delivery. Fundamental topics such linear and convex programming with gradient descent will help in understanding techniques in deep learning which will be useful for other AI courses. Recent applications of linear programs such as in designing security of critical infrastructure will be discussed in class.",

Image perception is the task of getting computers to see in a human like manner. To achieve this, researchers have pooled techniques and results from a large variety of different fields. This course introduces the mathematical tools and concepts underlying image perception. These include deep learning, linear algebra, statistics and multi-view geometry. The goal is to get students comfortable with utilizing and interpreting the results of state-of-art machine learning techniques. At the end of the course, students should be aware of what can be achieved by current visual perception techniques, how to achieve it and what the limitations of these techniques are. Students are expected to have a good mathematical foundation and programing skills. Foundational Mathematical Courses (i.e., CS103 or CS105) will be an advantage but are not insisted on. The primary programing language of the course is python. Having a good GPU at home will help with course work. Previously titled as CS424 Image Perception.",

      "This course examines the role of Enterprise Architecture in implementing a bank's digital business strategy while minimising the overall technology cost for the bank.  In today's market where the speed of doing business is rapidly increasing, and customers are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, banks are challenged to provide faster and better digital services, anytime, anywhere.  Technology, as a business enabler, has become a key consideration of any bank's strategy. The adoption of enterprise platforms such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Business Process Management (BPM), Business Rules Management System (BRMS), Master Data Management (MDM), and Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) will improve a bank's competitive advantage with measurable results; increased revenue, speed to market, product & service innovation, improved agility, and reduced cost. Emphasis is placed throughout this course on analysing real-world situations using case studies, in particular large-scale change scenarios such as; core banking system replacements, and bank mergers whereby multiple vendor products need to coexist.  Hands-on lab exercises and project assignments will include the assembly of prototype banking solutions which invoke the API of SMU Teaching Bank (SMU tBank).",

      "The importance of healthcare was never felt so keenly as during the COVID-19 pandemic. In its aftermath, there is a greater appreciation of the need to proactively build resilient and high-quality health systems, and to explore new innovations. With a rapidly ageing population, the burden of disease will increase even as the pool of potential care providers decreases. At the same time, the cost of healthcare needs to be contained, while meeting patient needs and keeping providers motivated. This calls for radical increases in the productivity of the healthcare sector. In this scenario, there is a need to understand complex systems concepts in assessing the impact of interventions. This technology-agnostic course will explore the context of the healthcare industry, with a particular focus on Singapore and Asia. Students will understand and apply the concepts of systems thinking and gain hands-on experience in both qualitative and quantitative simulation of health systems through the techniques of system dynamics, discrete event simulation, and agent-based modelling. The course will utilise cases and educational games, but also encourage students to build system simulation models. It will help students to broaden their horizons and develop critical thinking, while gaining practical skills in simulation and understanding the concepts of Digital Twins in social systems.",

      "Big data has become an essential part of our digital world in the last decade. Governments, e-commerce websites, even short video platforms, are now relying on big data technologies to gain business insight and design their strategies. Different from the traditional data analytics industry, the infrastructure of big data is mostly built on top of cheap commodity PCs and open source software.  This trend has successfully lowered the deployment as well as operational cost of such big data platforms. On the other hand, it raises new challenges to data engineers and scientists when building their own system with such infrastructure. This course aims to bridge the gap between the big data practice and the skills of undergraduate students in data infrastructure. It will provide an overview of big data infrastructure, which enables the student to build their own system based on the data characteristics and processing demands. It will get the students involved in the whole process of big data system building, i.e., the design, planning and implementation. It will also cover additional tools and techniques crucial to the success of big data, including data visualization, and monitoring. Students are expected to learn skills of 1) software development infrastructure in mainstream data-driven IT products; 2) data crawling and extraction frameworks for web-based data collection; 3) data storage architecture for highly variant data in big data systems; 4) massive data processing frameworks; 5) real-time and streaming data processing frameworks; 6) data visualization tools for big data analytics; 7) orchestration of the open source systems with high-level data interface.",

This timely course explores ethics in computing. Through case studies and frameworks, students will develop skills in critical and nuanced thinking about complex issues at the intersection of technology and society.
What you will find in this course:
Embracing Complexity: We won't seek single "right" answers. Instead, we'll foster a space for exploring multidimensional problems with interconnected tradeoffs, encouraging students to understand, appreciate, and engage with differing viewpoints.
Skill Development: Students will practise not just theory but systematic analysis of real-world impacts, preparing them for the consequential decisions they may face in their future careers.
Structured Exploration: The course is divided into two engaging parts. The first introduces fundamental concepts, while the second dives into contemporary dilemmas, exposing the tensions between responsible development and disruptive innovation.
Respectful Discourse: A commitment to respectful dialogue is central to this course. We recognise the intricate and "messy" nature of real-world problems, with ramifications extending far into a dynamic and uncertain technological future.
Distinct Focus on Technology: While courses like "COR3301 Ethics and Social Responsibility" provide a broad understanding of ethical conduct across various professions, this course specialises in the intersection of technology and ethics. This course targets the unique challenges of the digital age, equipping tech professionals with the nuanced understanding needed to navigate ethical dilemmas specific to computing, AI, and digital human rights. It's a tailored exploration for those aiming to align technological advancements with responsible decision-making.
Empowering Future Leaders: By attuning students to ethical imperatives and responsible decision-making processes, this course prepares the next generation of tech professionals to navigate and guide technological progress in a manner that honours human values and serves the greater good.

Prerequisites:
- Be a year 3 or year 4 student . As you need sufficient coursework exposure to do a good job in your IS483, it is best to take it later in your curriculum. Taking IS485/IS483 in the first term of year 3 is discouraged.
- A maximum of 4 (four) additional courses at SMU can be taken by a student in a term along with IS485/IS483/IS484.
- You must work on one of the tracks declared for your first major. If you are taking dual track, you can align to either of the two tracks. You cannot drop the track to which you have aligned your IS483/ IS484/ IS485 project as it will affect your graduation pre-requisites.
- IS483 projects can only be aligned to IS tracks and cannot involve tracks from other majors.
- For BA / DCS / FT / SMT track students, you need to pass the following courses
    - Software Project Management (IS212) is a co-requisite
    - Any two (2) track courses. One of these courses can be a co-requisite.
    - If the student drops the co-requisite courses in the same term that IS Project experience is being taken, the student will get an F for IS project experience.

Singapore is both a city and a country contained in a small geographical space located in Southeast Asia. It houses a diverse population in terms of race, language, religion, class and nationality. It possesses no natural resources, but has a highly educated labour force. Its economy has experienced significant growth rates, particularly in the late 70s and early 80s, coupled with low unemployment.

Like most other more developed economies, it now confronts a range of socioeconomic issues (rapidly ageing population, declining fertility rates, widening income inequality, rising costs of living) amidst increasing global competition, technological advancements, and security threats. At the same time, Singaporeans have become more of a people with a stronger national identity, a greater propensity to participate in the decisions that affect the destiny of the country, and a wider range of views and voices on the future direction of Singapore, the challenges it confronts, and the strategies and means by which to achieve their preferred goal(s) for themselves, their children, and the country.`,

We begin by tracing the formation of 'Orientalist' stereotypes about Asia in World Literature, illuminating the role these texts played in the Western colonial project. Next, we interrogate how Asian nationalists and creative practitioners sought to move beyond these Orientalist tropes by adapting Shakespeare's plays to create bold, new intercultural performances. We then dive into a range of canonical Asian texts and their contemporary adaptations. We ask what these texts can tell us about the connected political, cultural and technological histories of Asia and Europe; probe how these texts play shape our perceptions of racial, religious, national and gender differences; and ponder the place Singapore writers have in world literature today.",

    description: `The Anthropocene, derived from the Ancient Greek terms for human "anthropo" and new "-cene," has gained widespread interest through assessing the irrefutable characteristics and impact of human activities on global ecology. This interdisciplinary course seeks to situate the Anthropocene in Asia by exploring its impact on the region's politics, markets, societies, and selves. We will primarily draw on the fields of environmental studies, anthropology, cultural studies, history, geography, and sociology to critically examine the multifaceted dimensions of the Anthropocene in the region. In this course, we will explore contemporary debates around climate change, capitalism, biodiversity, and political and cultural ecology to understand the complex and interrelated challenges posed by these issues. In doing so, it will challenge us to rethink what it means to live, be, and thrive in the Anthropocene Asia. This course invites students to go beyond disciplinary paradigms and consider how emerging issues in the Anthropocene demand new ways of thinking, learning, and acting. Ultimately, we aim to foster a critical awareness of the Anthropocene and its impact on Asia, and to explore possibilities for sustainable and equitable futures.`,

It is characterised by both patterns of continuity across time and space, as well as far-reaching and rapid social and physical change. This course surveys a variety of contemporary trends and challenges found across Asia. By exploring weekly themes such as urbanisation, transnational migration, civil society and social movements, religious politics, security issues, environmental degradation, geopolitics and the role of China, economic growth and disparity, and regional structures like ASEAN and SAARC, students will gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of contemporary Asian societies. At some points in this course we will approach 'Asia' with a wide-lens, taking global, transnational, and regional perspectives, while at other times we will zoom in to particular experiences at a national or sub-national level. This is a survey course, and while students will be exposed to a wide range of issues relevant to contemporary Asia, they will also be encouraged to delve deeper into one or two select topics that are of particular interest to them.",

It examines forms of 'difference' such as ethnicity, religion and sexuality, and policy frameworks are important for multicultural societies. The course critically engages with the debates within scholarship of multiculturalism that encourages a theoretically-informed approach towards a range of empirical examples from Europe, North America and Asia. The analysis of empirical examples enables the consideration of demographic, cultural and ideological particularities, as well as nation-building efforts that vary across historical and geographical environments. This context-driven approach will also be taken towards the analysis of contemporary policy issues including citizenship, education and employment, including current debates such as disability in education and the 'headscarf affair'. The course also includes an applied component which allows students to put the theories to use and to experience how to deal with diversity through three dialogue sessions outside the campus.",

We live in a hyperconnected world – ecosystems and societies are linked like never before. This occurs through the movement of people, goods and products and the transfer of capital and information. At the same time, there is mounting appreciation of the need to address issues of equity and sustainability concurrently. To adequately understand, and ultimately to govern and regulate, for equitable-sustainability there is the need to identify and appreciate the complex feedbacks across activities of multiple individual, government and corporate actors across scales from the global to the local. This interdisciplinary course equips students with a grounding in concepts from the biophysical sciences, social sciences, law and governance. It focuses on key social, ecological and economic concerns in the context of biodiversity and climate change. By introducing students to systems and futures approaches it enables students to engage in sustainable and equitable governance for more desirable tomorrows.

This is mostly due to their limited knowledge and understanding of China, even if they can speak Chinese. This course aims to address this problem by enhancing the students' understating of the unique history, culture, economy, politics and law in China. To help the students understand the nuances of doing business in/with China, interesting cases and events will be used to illustrate how things work in China in real life. With the knowledge acquired in the course, the students will gain a better understanding of how business is conducted in China; the interaction between business on the one hand, and culture, politics and law on the other hand; as well as how foreign firms may survive and prosper in China.",

      "This course will explore interdisciplinary issues in EU-ASEAN law and relations. The EU and ASEAN are among the world's most advanced regional structures, representing distinct models of integration. Since the 1980s, the evolution of EU-ASEAN relations has offered valuable insights into the multifaceted concept of interregionalism in international law and relations. ASEAN became a priority in the EU's Asia policy agenda following the Treaty of Lisbon, and the European Commission's 2015 “Trade for All” strategy articulated an ASEAN approach based on individual agreements, culminating in a region-to-region framework. The recent conclusion of the EU's trade and investment agreements with Singapore and Vietnam reinforces this incremental approach towards realising the EU-ASEAN free trade agreement. Amidst China's changing status, the impasse in WTO negotiations, and the COVID-19 pandemic, EU-ASEAN legal frameworks and relations have gained prominence on the global stage. In 2020, the two blocs upgraded their “Dialogue Partnership” to a “Strategic Partnership,” which aimed at enhancing economic and security cooperation, sustainable connectivity, and development. In 2021, the EU's Indo-Pacific strategy underscored its engagement with the ASEAN-led regional architecture, particularly in light of the economic and political impact of the CPTPP and RCEP. In this SMU-X course, students will explore EU and ASEAN institutions and examine the EU's new Indo-Pacific strategy from legal and political perspectives. The course will specifically evaluate EU-ASEAN economic agreements and focus on cutting-edge areas such as trade and investment liberalisation, AI and digital trade, and sustainable development. Students will gain practical experience by collaborating with legal and policy experts to tackle real-world challenges. Please note: This course does not include an overseas trip and does not meet SMU's global exposure requirement. However, students will visit EU and/or ASEAN institutions in Singapore and engage in projects with legal and policy experts specialising in EU-ASEAN law and relations. The course will also incorporate SMU's blended learning approach, which may include some online sessions. The grade will be on a pass/fail basis.",

    description: `The world is rapidly urbanizing. More and more cities around the world are becoming increasingly popular as economic powerhouses and magnets for migrants from the countryside, suburban areas and other parts of the world. All big cities in both First and Third World countries as well as emerging markets such as New York, London, Tokyo, Paris, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Dehli, Jakarta etc. have to cope with high population density and serious challenges such as air pollution or traffic congestion. How do we pack more people into big cities and yet continue to achieve a high quality of life? How do we create and manage 'good cities' which are safe, spacious, green, connected, fair and resilient? How can cities create economic wealth while still fulfilling the CSR responsibilities of sustaining a “Green Planet”? What are the best practice designs and technical smart city solutions which could be leveraged to tackle these challenges and how can they be successfully commercialised? This course will provide answers to these questions with special emphasis on the managerial and commercial aspects of smart city concepts.

The key lies in creating and effectively managing innovative and sustainable, smart cities able to leverage on new technologies such as smart grids or sensor networks to create a place where people can live, play and work well. Starting from the stakeholder requirements of citizens and planners of innovative cities, the course will introduce students to urban design concepts as well as commercialization, management challenges and implementation issues of the smart city model. There will also be a focus on how good governance and enabling technologies such as sensor networks can facilitate the creation, management and sustainability of 'good' cities.

With the help of case studies and resource persons such as industry leaders, innovative city designers, tech experts and business development experts from local and int. companies such as ST Electronics, JTC, Jurong Consultants, Frost & Sullivan, IDA International, Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) etc., students will be familiarized with the opportunities and challenges of the 'smart city business' which represents a key element in the value creation and extraction strategy of the Singapore Government and related businesses.`,

As A.I. technology is already surpassing human decision-making in certain instances, there is growing concern about 'uncontrolled A.I.' in business and society, incl. regulatory and ethical-legal challenges. Against this background, this new course aims to equip students with foundational, theoretical and practical knowledge about A.I. driven business applications in selected private and public sector organizations. Besides reconstructing the history of artificial intelligence from the 1960s to the current era (as well as a refresher about the basics of computer science algorithms such as audio and video compression algorithms), we will put emphasis on explaining the A.I. driven business models of several top international and local organizations. In order to appreciate the power of A.I. technology, we will take a closer look 'under the A.I. hood' to understand what makes machine learning, deep learning, neural networks and image analysis tick. Visits to A.I. powered business organizations engaged in customer service management, finance, marketing, supply chain management or manufacturing will be organised aimed at appreciating both the benefits and downside of A.I. Students graduating from this course will be equipped with critical competencies to solve real-world business problems using A.I. technology while simultaneously casting a critical eye on the morality and ethics of commercialising A.I.",

      "Our world is characterized by the phenomena of VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity) and overload (of attention, information, stimulation, and work). This affects our attention, emotions, cognitions, well-being, functioning, and performance. It challenges our ability to flourish, to both feel well and do well. In this course, we explore the science and practice of mindfulness as a way of flourishing at work and in life. Mindfulness-based practices are rooted in Eastern contemplative traditions but have been adapted to a secular, modern context. A large amount of research has accumulated, showing that such mindfulness-based practices confer numerous benefits both for well-being and functioning, including at the workplace. “Mindfulness at work” has two meanings in this course: First, we will focus on mindfulness in the context of work and organizations. Second, we will incorporate mindfulness practices such as mindfulness meditations into the course itself. Thus, in this course, we will examine both the science as well as the practice of mindfulness. For the science aspect, we will read and discuss scientific research studies on mindfulness related to each of the course topics. For the practice aspect, we will engage in mindfulness practices based on established and carefully designed secular mindfulness trainings. The practice aspect is integral to this course and students will be required to commit about 20-45 minutes daily to these practices. Evidence suggests that the practices can help individuals feel and function better and are a good investment of the students' time.",

At the general level, we can construe SWB as the relative presence of positives and absence of negatives. However, what are these positives and negatives, how do they combine and inter-relate, and why and how do they matter? The psychological study of subjective well-being attempts to address these questions using an evidence-based approach grounded in the scientific method and the empirical research on the constructs, causes, correlates, and consequences of SWB. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the scientific literature and psychological study of SWB. Although the primary focus is on SWB at the individual level due to the inherently subjective nature of the construct, we will also discuss issues and implications in the contexts and levels beyond the individual such as the team, organizational or national levels.",

      "Singapore is a fascinating subject of sociological inquiry. Constructing Singapore's history remains a struggle against competing notions of the state as a tool of British colonialism, an adjunct of Malaysia before its untimely expulsion, immigrants' lay-over and Lee Kuan Yew's political success. Since independence, Singapore's leaders lament its lacking natural resources to justify their “pragmatic” management of the everyday lives of Singaporeans, including speech, educational environment, sexuality, religious expressions, ethnic identity and political culture, at the expense of citizens' rights. Populated dominantly by ethnic Chinese with Malays and Indians as minorities, yet geographically surrounded by Muslim-majority nations have made the ruling PAP reluctant to observe multiracialism in governance policies which compromises the nation-building project. Presently, forces of globalisation threaten the state's monopoly over political space and ideologies. This module targets students interested in developing a critical appreciation of the socio-economic and political contexts that structure Singaporeans' daily lives. It highlights critical historical circumstances that shape Singapore's post-independent governance policies, political discourses and contemporary development as a nation-state. It sharpens students' sociological imagination as they deconstruct political ideologies to grasp alternative interpretations of the development of Singapore society and make sense of contemporary issues of importance in Singapore and to Singaporeans.",

    description:
      "The past 20 years have seen several epidemics and pandemics: 2003 SARS, 2009 Flu Pandemic, the continuing Ebola outbreaks since 2014, and now, COVID-19. Discussions about preparedness for an outbreak abound and systems of biological research, biomedical interventions, and global health measures are implemented to contain and resolve an outbreak. Governments and communities respond by suspending some privileges as scientists and institutions fast-track therapeutic solutions. While these events may feel “unprecedented,” epidemics have occurred in the past. The key is to understand what has changed and what has remained similar. This course examines epidemics from the perspectives of history of biomedicine, global health, and the life sciences. Understanding the history of epidemics will help us attain a comprehensive understanding about what epidemics actually are. This knowledge will also aid in our social responses to COVID-19 in our everyday lives, chart informed biomedical interventions and potential socio-political actions. We will explore questions such as, How have epidemics shaped society? How did the biomedical practices around epidemics arise? Are vaccines really the “magic bullet” to solve all of our problems?",

      "This course is dedicated to curious laypersons. In your professional life after graduation, whatever your chosen field, you will face two certainties. First, a professional matter which involves machine learning or the Blockchain. Second, you will work with a lawyer! This course gives you a toolkit, a shorthand for constructive dialogue with a lawyer's concerns, to solve your problems within your domain expertise. Consider this example: what is your understanding of a “token”? A banker might think about asset ownership records, and link a “token” to “accounts”. To a programmer, a “token” could be a technical standard for a fungible unit of value on the Blockchain. In contrast, a lawyer understands a “token” based on legislation or judge-made law. Significantly, lawyers have an exclusive right to advocate for all your professional interests in a court of law. This course will cover legal reactions to technological innovations in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We will examine case studies in Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain concerning, for instance, autonomous vehicles and smart contracts, which are dumb contracts. Lawyers are trained to shape these realities with words by manipulating natural language. You will understand how – and why - lawyers convert the realities of algorithms and codes into legalese to mitigate harm against persons, to aid commercial growth and resolve its disputes.",

Students without this necessary prior knowledge will be responsible for acquiring the knowledge on their own.\nThis course focuses on the audit of financial statements by the external auditor, and is designed to:\n1. provide students with an in-depth knowledge and understanding of key auditing and assurance concepts and methodologies;\n2. develop the skills and attitudes necessary for providing financial statement audits and other assurance services, including problem-solving and decision making, critical thinking, communication, teamwork, interpersonal skills and professional values and ethics;\n3. develop analytical, strategic and systems thinking through the merging and melding of information from related disciplines;\n4. inculcate in students an attitude of active learning at both individual and team level, through students' pre-seminar preparation, involvement in seminar discussions, seminar activities and project work; and\n5. develop the mindset and values required to succeed in the profession.",

      "In today's volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world, corporations face increasing dimensions of risks in their businesses. Volatility in financial and physical markets, the failure of systemically important financial intermediaries, global climate and health crises, shifting social expectations and corporate governance concerns can directly or indirectly impair the financial, manufactured, natural, human, intellectual and social capitals of corporations. The ability to recognize, measure, manage and communicate such risks becomes critical to the long-term sustainability of corporations.\nThis course examines recognition, measurement, reporting and disclosure requirements for corporations in relation to financial and non-financial risks under the frameworks of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and other related bodies. Concepts, principles, and applications—with respect to market, counterparty, and sustainability risks—will be discussed from the perspectives of different stakeholders. While the focus of the course will be primarily on accounting and financial reporting, an integrated approach will be adopted.",

Increasingly, accountants are expected to create value for businesses through the use of technology and DA tools are often regarded as the first step in transforming raw data into knowledge that can be acted upon by decision makers.\nGiven the heavy use of statistics in applying analytics to accounting data, this course aims to provide students with the foundation in statistical analysis of accounting data and information.

Its significance is re-inforced in the recommendations by the Committee to Develop the Accountancy Sector (CDAS) in 2010. The CDAS' report, titled “Transforming Singapore into a Leading Global Accountancy Hub” identified and recommended internal audit as a niche pathway toward accountancy excellence for Singapore. Internal audit is an essential pillar of a resilient organization. This course provides participants with a sound foundation of internal concepts and practices. It provides an overview of internal audit in support on sound governance and risk management. The course content covers essential standards and guidance articulated by the Institute of Internal Auditors.

      "Traditionally, the accounting function's role is always viewed as that of a steward, the control centre for the organisation, rather than the catalyst for enterprise growth. The term 'back office' is often used to describe the operating nature of accounting function. So in today's volatile global business environment, the key challenge for accounting function is how to lead the enterprise in its growth strategies while ensuring effective risk management and stewardship of the enterprise. With complexity and data proliferation, increasingly the CEO and the board turn to accountants to help make sense of all the data, to help cut through this complexity, and to provide more informed analysis on the business and its operation. The opportunity for accounting function is if it can generate the insights that help make better corporate decision making, while continuing to ensure effective control of the enterprise, its reputation as a catalyst for growth will be guaranteed. To do so, traditional accounting departments may have to transform themselves into 'intelligent accounting functions'. Intelligent accounting functions run their operations as cost effectively as possible, leveraging technology to reduce finance operating costs; strengthen stewardship and control so as to establish a solid foundation to support growth. The biggest challenges, however, lie in creating the efficiencies needed to gather and process basic financial data and continue to deliver traditional finance outputs while at the same time redeploying their limited resources to enable higher-value business decision support activities. This accounting analytics practicum which adopts SMU-X approach, focuses on a few key topics that are vital to establishing an intelligent accounting function (refer to the diagram below): finance strategy and transformation, lean finance and finance shared services, business intelligence analytics, and enterprise process management. In this experiential learning course, students from various disciplines learn what comprises a highly optimised accounting process, design an end-to-end process management and explore the underlying accounting IT systems and advanced data analytical applications. By working closely with instructors from accounting and information systems disciplines, together with an industry partner, students are expected to carry out design and development of an intelligent accounting function solution. The whole idea is to engage students in real-life application and to encourage students to creatively apply concepts to practical problems in their pursuit of solving real-world problems. Students will apply the concepts in real projects.",

Increasingly, organizations also want to increase their engagement with key opinion leaders like social media influencers and understand how tools like TikTok can help them disseminate organizational messages. The course equips students with the knowledge of how to engage the Tier 1 mainstream media (otherwise known as earned media) drawing on Pang's (2010) Mediating the Media model. It also equips students on how to complement this with the organization's owned and shared media. As leaders of the future, regardless of which industry you are in, it is important to understand how the Tier 1 media work. It is a useful course for students of all disciplines - in your roles as domain experts in the respective fields, consultants, organizational leaders or communication professionals as you would need to engage the media.

Even as we speak, we have just emerged from a global crisis, Covid-19, that has engulfed the world.\n\nThis course equips students with the necessary skills and abilities to prepare for organizational crises, diagnose the nature of the crises, how to communicate during crises, and how to recover and learn from crises.\n\nAs leaders of the future, it is important to understand how crises can impact the organization. It is a useful course for students of all disciplines: Some of you will be leading crisis management and communication in your roles as domain experts in the respective fields or as organizational leaders, others may become consultants or communication professionals who work with C-suites to navigate through crises.\n\nIt also prepares you for work in all sectors - be it corporate, public, not-for-profit, or for those who want to work in overseas markets.",

This course is your opportunity to learn to apply creative and collaborative tools, such as brainstorming and prototypes, to real-life challenges with a particular focus on how to communicate (i.e., pitch) innovative solutions. As we will discuss design thinking case studies at many Fortune 500 companies, you will be first introduced (in the form of interactive lectures) then practice (through hands-on workshops) the design thinking process. Designs go through many iterations and you will also refine your project multiple times. The course culminates in a group project pitch in front of external judges, who are ready to mentor (and sometimes even invest in) students to turn their entrepreneurial ideas into the next unicorn start-up.",

When addressing such questions in organizational settings, communications managers often rely on what they know from executive experience and/or conventional wisdom, executing a number of communication strategies aiming at having a desired impact. This course will show how strategies that may hold intuitive appeal can be challenged and better informed by psychological principles underlying human judgment and decision-making. Students will learn the key psychological principles about how people process information in a given context and how to assess the conditions under which intended and/or unintended consequences arise. The learning, in turn, can be transformed to exert a competitive edge by identifying contributing and constraining factors of strategic communication to make an impact",

This course introduces students to the essentials of effective IR and covers the various methods that publicly-listed companies can employ to successfully communicate with the global investment community, including institutional investors, retail investors, analysts, financial media, financial bloggers and regulators. The course will look into the development of a company's investor communication strategy and investment narrative. Groups of students will role-play as Investor Relations practitioners to plan, develop and execute investor relations communications for a company through its life cycle. Three real-world scenarios will be introduced to provide students with insights into how a company can respond to an investor relations crisis, a merger & acquisition transaction, and a change in corporate strategy. Groups will work through the investor communications for these scenarios with the objective of developing appropriate narratives to secure buy-in from the financial community and protect the reputation and valuation of the company. Students will also examine the digital and mainstream building blocks of IR tools, which are integral parts of a sound IR programme, and understand how data analytics can be used to enhance shareholder identification and targeting. As part of the course, students will also develop a 12-month investor communications programme to engage IR stakeholders.",

      "This course introduces statistical concepts and basic tools used in modelling and analysing spatial data: data on variables that are correlated in 'space/location' (geo-tagged data). Spatial data are commonly used in regional science and urban economics (related to property prices, crime, household income, etc.), epidemiology and public health (such as disease clusters, etc.), environmental science (air pollution, ozone density, etc.), ecology, biology, geology and other disciplines.\n\nWe start by looking at the practical aspects of organising and visualising spatial data where we will discuss methods available to organise and visualise (i) vector data and (ii) raster data using the R programming language. These are the two main ways in which spatial data are maintained. We also discuss how to use a coordinate reference system to give spatial awareness to a dataset and make meaningful maps including animated and interactive maps using OpenStreetMap and others.\n\nWe then consider the statistical aspects behind spatial data analysis with a special focus on how to re-align classical statistical methods towards spatial data. An outline is given to the three broad types of spatial data in spatial statistical analysis: (i) geostatistical data, (ii) areal data and (iii) point patterns. Standard spatial regression techniques are used to build models to explain attributes that are spatially correlated such as the number of COVID cases. These techniques are fully implemented using R throughout the course. You may follow the links to get a flavour of the applications in this course.",

This course emphasizes training in mathematics used in economics through the many economic applications in which mathematical tools are needed.\n\nThe course covers five main topics. The first part covers the basics, such as functions and set theory. The second part teaches matrix algebra in relations to equilibrium analysis, while the third part introduces the concept of comparative statics and the tools needed, derivatives. The fourth topic again uses derivatives to do a rigorous exposition on the most important skill in economics: optimization. Part five introduces integrals and how they are used in dynamic analysis. In each part, there will be many economic applications to let students familiarize with the mathematical concepts in an economic context and learn their real-world usefulness.",

      "This course is the first part of a two-course Macroeconomics sequence. The aim of the sequence is twofold. First, it is to introduce students to modern macroeconomic theory, in particular formal macroeconomic models built on micro-foundations. Second, it is to develop a deep understanding of macroeconomic phenomena such as business cycles, long-term economic growth, and the process of economic development, as well as macroeconomic policy issues, such as the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on the economy and the design of a social security system or an unemployment insurance scheme.\n\nThis first part of the sequence first covers the topic of measurement of macroeconomic variables, before easing students into micro-founded macroeconomics by developing a static general equilibrium model with production and using it to analyze a number of fiscal policy issues. The course then moves on to a dynamic framework and covers the mechanics of long-term economic growth and the role of policy in economic development. Students are then introduced to dynamic decision problems when considering consumption and savings decisions of households and investment decisions of firms, and these building blocks are combined with a Walrasian approach to the labor market to complete the development of a dynamic macroeconomic model, which is then used to consider fiscal policy questions like the role of the timing in taxes and government expenditures. The course ends with an in-depth analysis of the data and mechanics of long-term economic growth and the role of policy in economic development.",

      "This course is part of the Health Economics & Management major to equip graduates for a role in healthcare management. The course will start with a discussion of quality and efficiency of healthcare service delivery. Topics covered will include the definition, measurement, management and strategic planning of the quality of healthcare services and approaches to paying for healthcare. There will be an investigation of ways to make service delivery more efficient by improving systems and controls and utilising advanced IT systems. The course will also cover the key management principles for preparedness in the event of major disease outbreaks and their control. Besides health risk management in crisis, students will learn strategies and methods for managing public media and containing the level of public anxiety until the situation returns to normalcy.\n\n *** This class will also be taught by staff and faculty from Singhealth and/or Singhealth Academy and students will have to attend site visit and classes as listed in the Weekly Lesson Plan below. Note that for Week 09, students will be required to be in a Singhealth facility for the lesson. As such, DO NOT bid or register for the course if you intend to take classes in SMU campus before or after that time slot as you will need time to travel to and from the Singhealth facility. ***",

of both theory and empirics. The course will begin with distinguishing between
the concepts of growth and development and motivating the study of economic
growth. The neo-classical growth model will be introduced as a framework for
understanding how growth occurs. The course will then unpack the model part
by part, both theoretically and empirically, for a more nuanced understanding
of growth. Its ingredients such as human capital formation will be studied. Its
assumption of perfect institutions will be examined with a particular focus on
property rights, corruption, and financial development. The causal impact of
institutions on growth will be explored. Finally growth theory will be revisited
to see how poverty traps arise as a result of imperfect institutions leading to
emergence and persistence of poor economic outcomes. The course will end
with an introduction to political economy of development where we will explore
reasons why inefficient policies are often chosen.`,

    description: `This course is designed as an introductory course to study housing finance systems and housing market outcomes. It provides an overview of real estate markets, including both residential properties and commercial real estate, as well as public policies that affect these markets. The beginning of the course will focus on what determines house price movements (captured by house price indices) and the role of real estate cycles (including bubbles) in mortgage default. The course will then be devoted to analyzing mortgage instruments used to finance investments in real estate. This includes calculations of payment streams for different types of mortgages, consideration of different types of mortgage contracts that shift interest rate and default risk between lenders and borrowers, and the role of the secondary market for mortgage securities. The last portion of the course will be devoted to evaluating pricing and risk in commercial real estate markets (REIT structures). Equipped with aforementioned skills, this course helps students to develop an eye towards the role of housing and mortgage markets in the recent financial crisis as highlighted in the United States and potential policy implications for the local market.

It first begins with demand-and-supply analysis of health and medical care and production of health. It then discusses the importance of asymmetric information (adverse selection, moral hazard) in insurance markets. Other topics covered include behaviors of key players (physicians, hospitals, pharmaceuticals) in the health care sector, the role of government in the provision of health care, and issues in health care system reform. Finally, this course discusses health policy debates in developing countries. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to evaluate current health care policy issues from an economic perspective.`,

    description: `This course is the second part of a two-course Macroeconomics sequence. The aim of the sequence is twofold. First, it is to introduce students to modern macroeconomic theory, in particular formal macroeconomic models built on microfoundations. Second, it is to develop a deep understanding of macroeconomic phenomena such as business cycles, long-term economic growth, and the process of economic development, as well as macroeconomic policy issues, such as the impact of fiscal and monetary policy on the economy and the design of a social security system or an unemployment insurance scheme. This second part of the sequence first reviews the topics of consumption and savings, investment, and the labor market covered in ECON 112 (Macroeconomics 1) and enriches the analysis by considering the impact on consumption and investment decisions of (a) imperfections of the financial sector, for instance leading to the existence of credit constraints, (b) uncertainty, and (c) adjustment costs, as well as by introducing the flow approach to the labor market and using the search and matching framework to understand labor market data and policies. The course then introduces the notion of money and considers the role of financial intermediaries, which are then used to study the long-term impact of monetary policy as well as the role of banking supervision and macro-prudential regulation. The course finally studies business cycles and covers the measurement of cycles, reviews the main existing theories and their policy prescriptions, with a particular emphasis being put on severe recessions or depressions.`,

    description: `This course seeks to provide the student with a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the main aspects of valuing equity securities. The first portion of the course lays a foundation for equity valuation by discussing in detail equity return concepts and factors driving firm performance. Then, we cover discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, which derives the price of equity as the discounted value of future cash flows. In addition, the course describes relative valuation methods, which uses appropriate characteristics (such as the price-to-earnings ratio) to identify over-valued and under-valued stocks. Besides traditional approaches, this course also discusses how unstructured data such as news can be associated with stock valuation.`,

    description: `The primary objective of this course is to provide an understanding of a wide variety of issues related to the financing of entrepreneurial firms. The approach will be based on the economics and finance of entrepreneurial firms and financial intermediation – tracking the corporate life cycle and concomitant financing pathways available to an entrepreneur at various stages from start-up to growth, IPO, and finally cashing out via LBO. This 'Corporate Life Cycle' approach provides a critical building block for those interested in how Private Equity works. The course has an analytical nature, not an institutional nor a descriptive one. Students will learn how to understand rigorous theoretical arguments, perform simple valuation modelling techniques, analyse and evaluate practical frameworks in order to formulate or make critical decisions and recommendations, through case study discussions and group exercises. The course will require both individual and teamwork. Individual work will be necessary to prepare for class discussions, assigned readings and case studies required for the exam. Teamwork in the valuation exercise and case studies will lead students to a unique opportunity to experience the discussion and management of complex, real-world problems.`,

      "The objective of this course is to introduce wealth management and advisory needs/focuses across client segments spanning from the mass-affluent space to the private high net-worth individual (HNWI) space. Wealth management is to grow, preserve, and transfer wealth to future generations. The traditional focus in investment management has primarily been on institutions. However, with the large growth in private wealth globally and particularly in Asia, wealth management for HNWIs is fast emerging. The course begins with a macro view on the wealth management landscape before advancing to understand the similarities and differences between managing wealth for institutions versus for individuals. With individuals, we will appreciate the need for different investment products and wealth solutions across client segments based on needs and suitability. Students will learn how to risk profile a client using behavioural finance knowledge and models, prepare an investment policy statement (IPS) for a particular client's profile and be able to suggest an asset allocation based on the IPS. As the life cycle stages of a client progresses, the wealth advisory approach must incorporate retirement planning. Students will learn the iterative wealth management and advisory process where client profiling, monitoring and review of investment portfolios, implementation and executions of the investment plans are conducted regularly and dynamically across the life cycle stages of a client. Ethical behaviour builds trust. We will examine ethical conduct in the investment advisory process and the corporate governance process of banks to encourage ethical behaviour of client advisors. Last but not least, we will introduce sustainability investing as a preference in client's IPS and how to approach ESG requirements of the client.",

      "This course focuses on the real estate development cycle. The main stages of real estate development are (a) pre-development planning, (b) project inception and roll-out, and (c) post-project management. The first stage consists of activities centred on a feasibility study and due diligence, which will include site planning and development parameters. The next stage is to commence the development, which will include site selection, investigation and evaluation, market study, project management, procurement and regulatory issues. The last stage involves implementing post-project activities including leasing or selling the property, post-construction management and yield enhancement. Each stage has business, financial and operational risks. The course will discuss the embedded activities in the value chain of real estate development for the various sectors, namely, residential, offices, industrial and commercial properties. This course will also impart knowledge about the fundamental elements of a building.",

    description: `Today's businesses and investors are increasingly dealing with the risks and opportunities of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, due to the scarcity of resources, conflicts in community and labor relations, and climate change. Meanwhile, more and more investment managers have stepped in to offer impact products in their portfolios as investors begin to evaluate how they can invest in ways that can meet financial goals and support social and environmental change. Bridging the gap between traditional capitalism and a new context of shared economic and social value, sustainable finance is quickly becoming a core part of the mission of financial institutions and companies.

This course couples established and emerging theory on how finance can be used to address sustainability challenges. It covers diverse aspects of sustainable finance, including ESG measurement, socially responsible and impact investing, integrated reporting, risk management, product market competition, and ESG issues along the supply chain to provide sophisticated and rigorous training at the nexus of sustainability and financial management. The course will also explore the meaning and importance of sustainable business practices that respect and adhere to ethical social responsibility standards through several case studies and simple econometric analyses. By the end of this course, students will gain a foundation in the understanding of how regulations and market forces provide incentives that encourage desired corporate and investor behaviors.`,

      "Today's businesses and investors are increasingly dealing with the risks and opportunities of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, due to the scarcity of resources, conflicts in community and labor relations, and climate change. ESG risk management is increasingly vital for companies due to several compelling reasons: 1. Reputation and Brand Value: Companies with strong ESG practices are perceived more positively by consumers, investors, and other stakeholders. Managing ESG risks helps protect and enhance a company's reputation and brand value, reducing the risk of negative publicity and boycotts. 2. Regulatory Compliance: Governments and regulatory bodies are imposing stricter ESG-related regulations. Effective ESG risk management ensures compliance with these regulations, avoiding fines, legal action, and operational disruptions. 3. Investor Demand: Investors are increasingly considering ESG factors in their investment decisions. Companies that manage ESG risks well attract more investment and often benefit from lower capital costs. ESG performance is now a key metric for many institutional investors and funds. 4. Operational Efficiency and Cost Savings: Managing environmental risks can lead to more efficient resource use, waste reduction, and energy savings. Social and governance improvements can enhance employee satisfaction and productivity, reducing turnover and associated costs. 5. Risk Mitigation: ESG risks, such as climate change impacts, social unrest, and governance failures, can have significant financial and operational impacts. Proactively managing these risks helps companies avoid or mitigate potential losses and disruptions. 6. Competitive Advantage: Companies that excel in ESG risk management often have a competitive edge. They are better positioned to anticipate and adapt to market changes, meet stakeholder expectations, and capitalize on new business opportunities related to sustainability and ethical practices. 7. Long-Term Sustainability: ESG risk management supports the long-term sustainability of a company by addressing the broader impacts of its operations on the environment, society, and its governance structure. This holistic approach ensures the company can thrive in the future while contributing positively to the world. This course will investigate how ESG risk considerations can be integrated into a company's wider Enterprise Risk Management Frameworks. Focus here will be on Environmental Risk considerations (Climate Change and Nature/Biodiversity), given the importance and regulatory focus that these attract.",

      "Climate science indicates that to keep global warming within the 1.5°C threshold above preindustrial levels, we must reduce global emissions to reach net zero by 2050. Despite growing recognition of this imperative and increasing corporate commitments to decarbonisation, most of these commitments lack detailed and credible plans. Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 will require a fundamental transformation of the global economy, particularly in the energy and hard-to-abate sectors that contribute the most to global emissions. This transition demands significant investment, estimated at US$3-4 trillion per year, necessitating substantial scaling and deployment of both private and public sector capital. This course delves into decarbonisation pathways and key climate transition strategies within the energy and hard-to-abate sectors, equipping students with the knowledge and skills to assess credible transition planning and articulate key decarbonisation challenges and growth opportunities in the emergence of new clean technologies. The course also highlights the wider policy landscape and how significant government policies can influence the development of low-carbon products and their supply chains. Additionally, it explores various funding structures to finance companies' decarbonisation strategies, the meaning of sustainable business, and the need for companies to transition in a financially sustainable manner. By the end of this course, students will understand the challenges and opportunities associated with reducing carbon emissions in traditionally difficult-to-decarbonise sectors such as cement, steel, fossil fuel energy, and transport. They will gain foundational knowledge necessary for finance professionals to assess the viability and impact of decarbonisation and climate transition strategies. Students will learn about the technical processes and commercial viability of decarbonisation technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, and alternative fuels like hydrogen, as well as geographical considerations, national circumstances, and geopolitical factors. The course will also cover the role of international cooperation, government policies, and private sector initiatives in driving decarbonisation. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to contribute to the development and implementation of effective decarbonisation strategies, fostering a low-carbon future for Asia's most challenging sectors. The course is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects of decarbonisation and climate transition strategies. This includes analysis of viable pathways to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, focusing on the energy and hard-to-abate sectors; exploration of technologies such as carbon capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, and alternative fuels; examination of significant government policies and their impact on the development of low-carbon products and supply chains; an overview of different funding mechanisms to support decarbonisation efforts; discussion on the importance of financially sustainable transitions for businesses; and practical examples and case studies to illustrate successful decarbonisation strategies and initiatives. This course is designed to provide students with a well-rounded understanding of the critical issues and innovative solutions in the quest to reduce carbon emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy.",

We examine the cultural traditions that have shaped the region as well as the political influences and events that shape Southeast Asian countries today. In doing so, we study how the past has shaped the present. Thus, the course engages in a broad historical overview, but it is not designed to be a strictly history course. Rather, it is intended to equip students with a general knowledge of Southeast Asian cultures, histories, and politics.

The primary objective of this course is to empower students to critically engage with research findings across multiple disciplines by understanding the methods used, their strengths and limitations, and whether said methods have been used correctly. To do so, students will begin by interrogating the 'objectivity' of scientific evidence. Students will then be introduced (intuitively) to three fundamental statistical approaches: hypothesis testing, linear regression, and experimental methods. The use of these three fundamental approaches will be critiqued by examining how statistics are often done wrong and replicating existing studies. The second part of the course will highlight the interdisciplinarity of research methods and showcase the main research methods used in economics, politics, geography, and the behavioural sciences, with a focus on understanding the strengths and limitations of different research approaches and methods. The course will conclude with sessions focusing on fieldwork and research ethics.",

These 'modern problems' are central issues that plague communities across the globe and threaten the stability and sustainability of the societies where they are left un(der)addressed. Nonetheless, to identify these challenges (and the associated 'solutions') requires a scholarly lens that is best informed by an interdisciplinary and integrative approach which recognises the complexity of these problems. In this course, students will be exposed to a range of these 'modern problems', and be guided through approaches to them, drawing from insights from the fields of economics, geography, philosophy, political economy, and urban studies. By adopting a multi-perspectival approach to analysing problems, and solutions, students will be exposed to, and gain a deeper appreciation for the value of a multidisciplinary approach to problem-solving, and also have an opportunity to acquire skills to be adroit thinkers who are able to draw on multiple disciplinary traditions to inform their viewpoints and decisions..",

It will, in particular, introduce students to the use of technology which impacts business and consumer contracts, and the applicability of contract law rules in such situations. The study of the subject will provide students with an excellent opportunity to observe, evaluate and critique developments in the law in response to the dynamic environment of commerce.",

Different classification systems for torts will be examined: by interest, by the nature of the interference (intention, recklessness, carelessness, strict liability) and by whether consequential harm is needed (torts actionable per se). One goal will be to demonstrate the dynamic nature of law and its development to meet changing social and economic conditions. Before an examination of the various torts, the students will learn about the internal classification of torts and the relationship of the law of torts to other legal obligations.",

    description: `Under Singapore law, there are different ways in which businesspeople may organise commercial
                  activities with a view to maximising operational efficiency and minimising exposure to personal
                  risk. Most, however, will opt to incorporate a company for the purpose. This is however no indication
                  that the company is a simple structure. On the contrary, as the company is effectively a web of
                  different interests, rights and obligations, it is a highly complex structure. As such, the corporate form
                  is fittingly the most regulated of all business entities. In this course, we will examine how a company
                  is formed, the consequences of incorporation, how it is managed and controlled, what responsibilities
                  are visited upon those who exercise control over a company's assets, how a company transacts with
                  third parties, and how it raises capital. The course will also expose the student to issues relating to
                  shareholder rights and to creditor protection mechanisms. In addition, the student will be introduced
                  to corporate rescue and insolvency laws, as well as to corporate finance.`,

    description: `This course introduces principles of Singapore constitutional law and administrative law.
                  Constitutional law is concerned with the organisation of the state and the relationship between the
                  government, civil society, and the individual. Administrative law is about the governance of public
                  bodies exercising statutory or other powers or performing public duties.
                  In this course, we will be concerned with how law, institutions and norms promote good governance,
                  how political power and public law functions are legitimated, how abuses of public power are
                  prevented or remedied, and how to understand the proper relationship between the individual and
                  the state.
                  NB: This is a reading-intensive 1.5 cu course. This means that, as a general guideline, you should put it
                  at least 11/2 times the amount of time and effort that you do for your other 1.0 cu modules. `,

    description: `This course provides an overview of the fundamental principles and methodologies of the conflict of
                  laws (also known as private international law), with focus on their application in commercial
                  transactions. Cross-border commercial transactions are common in a modern globalised era. The
                  conflict of laws addresses three large questions: (1) in which country should the case be tried? (2)
                  which country's law should be applied to resolve the dispute? (3) What should be the legal effect in
                  one country of a judgment given in another? From the perspective of Singapore law, the questions
                  translate into: (1) When would or should a Singapore court hear the case (and sometimes try to stop
                  it from being heard in another country)? (2) Which country's law would or should the Singapore court
                  apply to resolve the issue before it? And (3) What legal effect would or should a foreign judgment
                  have in Singapore? This is a course on Singapore conflict of laws, but comparisons will be made from
                  time to time to the laws of other countries.`,

    description: `This course does not, in today's context, require a detailed and lengthy introduction.
                  Whereas the subject was once only encountered occasionally by students, the law of
                  intellectual property (IP) is now widely taught and studied. It is perhaps fair to say that
                  few branches of the law have, in recent times, developed as swiftly and explosively
                  across jurisdictions as the law of IP and its associated laws of information and
                  communications technology and electronic commerce. This is especially evidenced in
                  Singapore by, inter alia, the Government's push for a sound and comprehensive legal
                  framework for the promotion and protection of IP, and by the setting up of the
                  Intellectual Property Office of Singapore. Several amendments have also been made to
                  Singapore's IP legislation in order to implement the country's obligations under the
                  United States – Singapore Free Trade Agreement (which was concluded in May 2003).
                  More recently, the Copyright Act 1987 was repealed by Parliament and replaced by the
                  (new) Copyright Act 2021.
                  You will in this course be introduced to the different types of IP rights and the various
                  branches of IP law. Some of these rights include copyright, patent and trade mark rights.
                  We will also have the opportunity to explore, in some detail, the common law actions of
                  passing off and breach of confidence. Obviously, a course on IP extends beyond a prosaic 
                  2
                  examination of our domestic legal infrastructure and it is a subject that will also aid in
                  understanding entrepreneurial development in information technology.
                  The study of IP was, at one point, a somewhat esoteric specialisation. Today, IP occupies
                  a central position in the global, knowledge-based economy and this course should
                  therefore appeal to those who wish to equip themselves with knowledge of a burgeoning
                  and highly relevant area of the law.`,

                  Wrotham Park damages instead of normal damages? What if a defendant is insolvent? These are
                  some of the questions which a litigant may ask counsel, and which students will explore.

                  Taiwan was ceded to Japan by the Qing Dynasty under the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895. The
                  ROC was established in 1912 after overthrowing the Qing Dynasty. According to the Cairo
                  Declaration, the ROC assumed control of Taiwan after World War II. In 1949, following its defeat
                  in the civil war to the Chinese Communist Party, which established the People's Republic of China
                  (PRC), the ROC government relocated to Taipei. In 1971, United Nations General Assembly
                  Resolution 2758 transferred China's seat from the ROC to the PRC, leading to Taiwan's unique
                  status under international law.
                  Taiwan's legal system is based on the ROC Constitution promulgated in 1947. The ROC adopted
                  the Chinese legal system in Taiwan, influenced by Japan during its administration. Germany and
                  the United States have significantly influenced Taiwan's legal development in constitutional, civil,
                  and commercial law. The Legislative Yuan (Parliament) is Taiwan's unicameral legislature. The
                  Council of Grand Justices (Constitutional Court) of the Judicial Yuan holds the power to interpret
                  the Constitution. The Executive Yuan serves as the executive branch, with the Premier appointed
                  by the President, who is elected every four years by universal suffrage.
                  Today, Taiwan ranks among the largest Asian economies and operates as a vibrant democracy
                  under a two-party system since the lifting of Martial Law. In this course (under the Overseas
                  Project Experience (Law in Asia) model), students will examine various aspects of Taiwanese law
                  and explore Taiwan's legal relationships with the United States, China, and Singapore. They will
                  gain practical experience working with lawyers and legal counsels to address real-world legal
                  challenges.
                  This course is supported by the Taiwan Studies Project Grant from the ROC Ministry of Education.
                  Some sessions may be conducted online, and a one-week field trip to Taipei, Taiwan, is planned.`,

                  introduce participants to the role and function of arbitral institutions in guiding and shaping
                  the practice and development of international arbitration, and to the complex issues that
                  arbitral institutions face in the administration of arbitrations, including, among others, the
                  appointment of arbitrators and the issuance of arbitral rules and practice notes.
                  In this connection, SIAC has grown to be one of the most popular arbitral institutions not
                  just in Asia, but the world. The course involves a study of SIAC processes as well as related
                  case law emanating therefrom. Participants will learn not just what the relevant rules,
                  procedures and processes are, but more importantly, participants will gain insight into why
                  those rules exist, and how those rules are implemented in practice.
                  In addition to commercial arbitration, this course will also look at arb-med-arb protocols
                  and investor-state dispute settlement.
                  The course will be taught by experienced guest instructors from the Singapore International
                  Arbitration Centre (SIAC) and by other leading arbitration practitioners, who will share
                  their unique, practical perspectives on administering or advancing a particular case.

                  LLM-powered applications have demonstrated the impressive ability to produce natural, fluent text
                  in response to user inputs on a diverse range of topics, leading to claims that this will herald another
                  breakthrough in artificial intelligence and change how we work in ways we did not think possible.
                  In this course, we will study these LLMs in detail by exploring the way they are trained and
                  evaluating their capabilities through reviewing research papers and hands-on testing. We will also
                  discuss the risks and concerns associated with the use of LLMs as they are being deployed into an
                  increasing number of applications, driven largely by a combination of ease-of-use and impressive
                  performance. We will explore how these LLMs are currently being used in legal technology and
                  consider how they could impact the future direction of the legal profession.
                  While some of the topics in the course may come across as being technical, prior knowledge is not

                  evaluate OpenAI's GPT models or other open models.

                  spanning across investor-state, public international law, commercial and constructionrelated disputes. 
                  The course seeks to equip students with a broad understanding of issues
                  relating to energy contracts and disputes, from both a substantive and practical perspective,
                  viewed through the lifecycle of typical energy projects. This course will therefore be highly
                  relevant to both aspiring transactional and dispute resolution lawyers, and qualifies as a
                  capstone course for the Dispute Resolution track at the School of Law.
                  Participants will be introduced to the key features of energy projects and investments, the
                  parties involved, and some of the unique characteristics of disputes arising in the energy
                  sector. On disputes, the course also involves a study of both commercial and investor-state
                  arbitration, investment protection treaties and instruments in the energy sector, and related
                  case law in international arbitration arising therefrom. Participants will then gain an
                  understanding of the various strategic considerations on handling cross-border energy
                  disputes, including how to prevent them from the outset, and managing a dispute across
                  each stage of the dispute resolution process.
                  The course will involve two leading practitioners who will share practical perspectives on
                  the intersection between commercial and legal considerations. Participants will apply their
                  knowledge through class presentations and group discussions. Strongly recommended that students complement this course with the

                  transactional lawyer working on a general banking transaction.
                  Over the weeks, students will be walked through the lifecycle of a fictitious watered-down financing
                  transaction. As the transaction progresses, students will gradually be introduced to the various
                  financing legal documents (eg, term sheets, loan facility agreements, corporate authorisations) and
                  their key clauses. Crucially, students will also step into the shoes of transactional counsel and be
                  given several opportunities to “hold the pen” - students will be tasked to take instructions from their
                  clients and draft/review certain financing legal documents. Finally, students will participate in a
                  mock negotiation to iron out outstanding issues blocking the transaction from closing.
                  Through this course, students will have the opportunity to both gain insights on transactional
                  lawyering, as well as learn practical skills that will better prepare students to transition to their
                  upcoming lives as practice trainees and junior associates. Moreover, while this course is conducted
                  in the context of banking and finance, the practical skills taught in this course will nonetheless be
                  largely applicable to other fields of transactional law, including but not limited to mergers and

                  trade in both industrial and agricultural products, trade in services, labor mobility,
                  investment, free trade agreements, health and food safety, and a wide variety of domestic
                  regulatory regimes. Thus, it is important that lawyers advising business firms understand
                  these rules so they may help the clients to structure their transactions to maximize their
                  benefits and minimize the costs.
                  This course will help the students to study the legal rules of the WTO and free trade
                  agreements, which cover tariff measures, antidumping and safeguard measures, food safety
                  regulations, as well as domestic regulations of key WTO Members like the US & China.
                  Using real WTO cases decided by the WTO tribunals as examples, the students will be able
                  to critically examine how these rules are made, what are the impacts on business firms, how
                  to argue the best case for their clients, and how these rules could be improved in the future.
                  The knowledge and skills learnt in this course will be helpful for students to participate in
                  various WTO moot courts around the world, and explore a wide range of career options,

                  To start off, we will discuss the general regulatory framework for such deals, with focus on the
                  Singapore/UK vs the US approach. We will then discuss key considerations in structuring a

                  will engage in a mock M&A negotiation. This will require use of the skills and discussion of

    description: `Insolvency law is concerned with debtors who are unable to pay their debts. This course will
                  consider the rules, principles and processes which the law has developed to address this everpresent problem, focussing on insolvent debtors which are companies. In particular it will
                  cover the main formal insolvency proceeding in Singapore for companies, ie, liquidation. In
                  that context, the substantive policies and principles of the law will be addressed - e.g., the pari
                  passu principle, the concept of set-off, the avoidance of suspect transactions entered in the runup to insolvency, and the liability of corporate officers. In addition, the law relating to
                  company receivership will be addressed.
                  Further, Singapore corporate insolvency law has increasingly focussed on the avoidance of
                  liquidation through the restructuring of debts, ie, measures designed to help viable debtor
                  companies prevent unnecessary liquidation. Thus, the course will also cover the formal
                  restructuring procedures available in Singapore, ie, schemes of arrangement and judicial
                  management. These processes underwent very significant legislative reforms, now contained
                  in the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018, designed both to improve the
                  prospects of a successful restructuring and to enhance the status of Singapore as major
                  international debt restructuring centre. The course will also introduce another major change
                  under the IRDA reforms, the adoption by Singapore of the UNCITRAL Model Law on CrossBorder Insolvency, as well as other measures which address the issues arising in international
                  insolvencies. Note: Although not pre-requisites, it is recommended that students have either completed
                  or least be enrolled in Law of Property and Law of Equity and Trusts when taking this
                  course. Non-Law students require LGST201 Company Law with min Grade 'A' as prerequisite`,

    description: `The economic significance of major Asian economies is overwhelming and driving global
                  economic growth, and so are their intellectual property (IP) regimes. However,
                  insufficient attention has been paid to the latter. This course sets to explore the
                  significance of IP regimes to Asian integration and peace, the features of major Asian IP
                  laws, their contrast with other leading IP regimes of the world, and examine their
                  international dynamics and potentials, all against the backdrop of current geopolitics.
                  “Can Asian IP laws hold any light to the rest of the world?” and “Can major Asian
                  economies become IP norm-setters, rather than norm-takers?” This course will take a panAsian and integrated approach that mainly looks into IP laws and trade secrets protection
                  law of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the PRC (civil law jurisdictions), Singapore, and India
                  (common law jurisdictions). It will also touch upon HK, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the
                  Philippines when appropriate. The course will compare two Asian Giants, China with
                  India, and study the IP struggle of a mid-sized (Taiwan) and small economy (SG)
                  Students would be advised, not a pre-requisite, to be taking or have taken at least one IP law-related
                  course. It is not a pre-requisite to read any one major Asian language

                  moreso with the world still reeling from the unprecedented challenges in matters of
                  public health in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Coupled with better education and
                  exposure, our people expect to receive nothing less than a high quality of care. Not
                  surprisingly, litigation in this area has been on the rise. An awareness of the issues in
                  medical law and healthcare policies will surely equip lawyers to deal with this growing
                  trend. Areas to be covered in this course include access to healthcare, physician-patient
                  relationship, informed consent, regulation of medical practitioners under the Medical
                  Registration Act, regulation of TCM practitioners, Mental Capacity Act, ethics for
                  biomedical research, advanced medical directive and health insurance. Students will be

    description: `Whether you are an entrepreneur, a business consultant, or a lawyer, you will find yourself
                  negotiating every day. Sometimes you will negotiate in a professional capacity on behalf of a client
                  or your organisation; other times you will negotiate in your personal capacity. Your negotiations
                  may be transactional in nature or they may be focused on resolving a problem or a dispute. In this

                  challenges of complex and evolving global and local landscapes.

    description: `One of the hottest legal topics in the knowledge economy is the tension/conflict between
                  intellectual property law and competition law and its resolution. The fact that the patent
                  licensing practice of Qualcomm (world no. 1 chip designer in mobile communication) has been
                  challenged world over is an attestation in point. So are the antitrust suits against Google, Apple,
                  Microsoft, Intel and many other tech giants around the globe. To provide a systemic
                  understanding of this type of conflicts and prepare our students the ability to reach optimal
                  solutions that is beyond pure contract law is the goal of this module. This module will provide a
                  detailed general theory of IP laws (three-step-exchange) with fifteen principles applicable to all
                  areas of IP laws. It introduces competition law (both the general competition law on cartel,
                  abuse of dominance/monopolization and sector specific competition law from the US and the EU
                  and major Asian economies) and unfair competition which are rarely taught at SMU. It then
                  embarks on to establish the complementarity between competition law and the exercise of
                  specific IP rights. When so doing, it stands out Asian context and perspectives
                  
                  Students are required to have taken one course on IP law or competition law or they are at least

    description: `The corporation is the most important legal form for doing business around the world. The
                  corporate form significantly impacts our daily lives, shapes our societies, and sits at the core of
                  the world's most pressing issues from sustainability to geopolitics. And yet, conventionally, most
                  law students learn about the corporate form solely through an examination of the company law in
                  their home jurisdiction. While understanding company law in one's home jurisdiction provides a
                  valuable foundation for understanding the role that companies play in our world, it is just a starting
                  point. To more fully appreciate the implications of the corporate form in our world, it is necessary
                  to understand how the corporate form functions in different jurisdictions taking into consideration
                  the legal, historical, economic, political and cultural similarities and differences that impact
                  corporate governance in different jurisdictions – which is the aim of this course. Such an
                  understanding is valuable for practicing lawyers, policymakers and entrepreneurs in our
                  increasingly global business environment. This course begins by examining the core legal
                  characteristics of the corporate form across major jurisdictions. It then examines the common
                  agency problems that are inherent in the corporate form, compares the legal strategies that each
                  jurisdiction uses to solve these common problems, and grapples with the increasingly fraught
                  question about what the “purpose” of the corporate form should be. The course then examines
                  several of the most significant topics and policy debates in the burgeoning area of comparative
                  corporate law and governance, with an emphasis on Asia and Singapore. In exceptional circumstances,
                  students can be waived from the prerequisite requirement if they get the permission of the instructor. For
                  that purpose, they will need to send an email to the instructor explaining why they want to enrol

    description: `This course, Law of International Trade: ASEAN and EU Perspectives, will explain key legal issues arising
                  from the development of international trade, which are key to the expansion of businesses and
                  national economic growth. These issues are important for Singapore, a global trading nation that has
                  adopted an export-oriented policy and promoted the export of goods and services in international
                  markets. It is thus critical for business leaders and policymakers to understand the legal aspects of
                  domestic and international transactions, as well as global trade regimes.
                  To this end, the course will provide an overview of legal issues that apply to the sale of goods
                  transactions, including the meanings and application of trade terms such as CIF and FOB, and methods
                  of financing sales and transporting goods across borders. Moreover, the course will assess the
                  resolution of commercial and investment disputes, regulatory issues involving trade barriers to foreign
                  direct investments, and WTO principles. The major contents of “ASEAN Plus Six” trade and investment
                  pacts, as well as EU agreements with Singapore and Vietnam, will also be discussed.
                  This course is supported by the EU's Jean Monnet Chair program and will adopt SMU's blended
                  learning approach, including online sessions.

                  then progress to cover the major types of financial crime, such as: (1) cheating, criminal breach
                  of trust, criminal misappropriation of property, fraud, forgery, falsification of accounts and
                  receiving stolen property; (2) corruption; (3) market misconduct: insider trading and market
                  manipulation; (4) tax evasion; and (5) money laundering and terrorism financing. Efforts to
                  combat international financial crime, e.g. the setting up of the Financial Action Task Force, antimoney laundering procedures, and mutual legal assistance and exchange of information
                  regimes, will also be discussed.

    description: `This course provides an introduction to environmental sustainability and human development issues, and the
means of framing, analysing and solving such problems. As environmental and social problems mount around the
world, firms have become more attuned to the need to devise new products, services and strategies, and to
communicate these to a variety of stakeholders, even as they cooperate with them.
Environmental sustainability, and more generally, sustainability, has become increasingly important to developed
and developing nations alike. Typical issues include resource scarcity and polluted environments, but more
recently, global climate change has become the primary issue for many. In general, sustainability issues often
consist of complex interactions between human activity and the environment. The course will apply several
academic perspectives to characterizing these problems and their possible solutions.
The course will focus in particular on businesses' role in causing and addressing sustainability problems and on
how they moderate their impacts. An important part of addressing the sustainability of firms is the employment
of various concepts and frameworks that help incorporate the sustainability perspective into firms' strategies
and operations. To help characterize firms' sustainability and determine appropriate courses of action, the course
will cover specific managerial tools and frameworks. The primary focus will be on strategy and business models
that support change and its operationalization, but the course will also illustrate the role that “greening” other
business functions play in the sustainability of the firm, including those of marketing, supply chains, and financing.
The course will review core management frameworks to help non-business major students become familiar with
more sustainability-specific frameworks, practices and concepts to be covered. These tools are not only means
for improving a firm's sustainability performance, but also support its transparent and effective reporting.
Representative examples of sustainability measurement standards will be introduced and their potential impacts
in advancing corporate sustainability will be discussed. The course will also reflect on the general role of
innovation in all of this. Technology issues covered include the role of information technology in addressing
poverty, and solutions that reorganize the industrial system (e.g. renewable energy policies, and industrial
ecosystems or industrial symbiosis, i.e., industries that incorporate recycling loops at regional levels). `,

      "To achieve superior performance in an increasingly dynamic and uncertain global business environment, companies in every industry must create internal capability to harness strategic change for sustainable competitive advantage. However, companies that are able to strategically change their entrenched ways of doing things and then reclaim leading positions are the exception rather than the rule. With the industry 4.0 upon us and fast advancement in digital technologies, firms in many industries would find it even more pressing but challenging to build the managerial capabilities to cope with the digital transformation that will reshape the business landscape tremendously for the future. Against this backdrop, this course discusses how companies can effectively manage the strategic change and digital transformation that will significantly impact the way the business is configured for competitive advantage. Besides the internal managerial challenge, the course also emphasizes that companies must cope with strategic interactions with different industry players to create value collectively and continuously. With respect to digital transformation, the course discusses digital concepts and technologies such as omni-channel, platforms, eco-systems, blockchain, IOT, AI, and cloud computing etc. that impose both challenges and opportunities for strategic change management in the increasingly technology-based, internet-based, and data-based business contexts.",

      "This builds on the course 'Strategy'. Corporate strategy is the pattern of decision-making that determines a firm’s goals and objectives, produces principal policies, defines the range of business to pursue, and pertains to the overall plan for a diversified firm. A firm’s corporate strategy acts as both a catalyst for and a constraint on the strategies of its business units. If the business strategies do not support the firm’s corporate strategy, synergy becomes impossible. Therefore, this progression reinforces the inextricable link between business strategy and corporate strategy, with cases of business integration, strategic alliances, corporate diversification, and mergers and acquisitions. Drawing on these factors, the major objective of this course is to help student to understand: 1) conditions under which different types of corporate strategy have the potential to create (economic and social) value, competitive and corporate advantages; and 2) organizational and managerial systems that must be in place in order to realize this potential value creation.",

In the current business landscape, companies face a multitude of risks and opportunities, driven by the dynamic and uncertain global environment. Significant challenges faced by firms across industries is the rapid advancement of digital technologies, the emergence of Industry 4.0 and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. To achieve superior performance and sustainable competitive advantage, organizations must proactively recognize and address these factors. Digital transformation of industries not only reshapes the business landscape but also introduces new risks and opportunities, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity. Protecting sensitive data and information from cyber threats becomes paramount in this context. Simultaneously, organizations must develop managerial capabilities to effectively navigate the changing digital landscape and mitigate these risks. While this poses significant challenges that demand attention, it also presents opportunities for companies to capture. The course aims to address these challenges comprehensively. It will explore how companies can effectively manage strategic change to configure their businesses for competitive advantages. Participants will gain insights into digital concepts and technologies such as omni-channels, platforms, eco-systems, blockchain, IoT, AI, and cloud computing, understanding their potential benefits and the associated risks. They will also learn tools and techniques to managing strategic risks and leveraging opportunities. By focusing on the risks and opportunities associated with strategic change, digital transformation, cybersecurity, etc. in the contemporary business environment, this course equips students with the necessary knowledge and skills to navigate these challenges effectively. Through informed decision-making and proactive measures, organizations can harness these factors to achieve sustainable competitive advantage while also fulfilling their responsibilities to stakeholders and the broader society.`,

      "All firms have processes, most of which can be improved or optimized. Some of these processes include innovation, development, manufacturing, services, internal and external processes. The ability of managers to define, measure, improve and control processes is a key skill set and, combined with leadership, can enhance the success of a firm. In this course, students will develop a combination of practical tool knowledge and project management skills to effectively change and improve important processes. Students will also gain a strong theoretical and practical understanding of six sigma deployment and will have the opportunity to achieve SMU Six Sigma “Greenbelt” certification. Students will learn the DMAIC methodology (Design, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) and apply it in real projects. These projects will be sponsored by SMU, local SME’s and MNC’s. This course will also allow students to further develop and get feedback on the following SMU Graduate Learning Outcomes: disciplinary knowledge, critical thinking and problem solving, collaboration and leadership, communication, self-directed learning, and resilience.

This course introduces Design Thinking (similar to the IDEO approach – www.ideo.com) and its application to developing new “things” (i.e. products, services, experiences and business models). The course is divided into four main aspects, all interconnected but separately emphasized: (1) design methodologies (e.g. ethnographic research, brainstorming, prototyping), (2) the “thing” to be designed (3) attitudes and behaviors and (4) design contexts. Design contexts refer to the broader emerging context for designs and business, specifically, society (including different cultures and the poor), and the physical environment. Learning will be primarily experiential in nature – through class discussion, group exercises, and a team project. Guest speakers with practical experience in Design Thinking may be invited as well.`,

The course develops in students an ability to: strategically position the client and its challenge within an environmental context; appropriately scope the challenge of the client; develop and execute a workplan to address the challenge; and develop solutions by establishing a fact-base through directed primary and secondary research, drawing out relevant insights through analytic review, and engaging in abstract idea generation. The course exposes students to the uncertainties and ambiguity that exists within real-world business landscapes and organisational environments of industry clients, as well as, the challenges with engaging busy business executives and convincing them and their organisation of innovative solutions that have been devised by the students that address the client's real-world challenges.`,

    moduleCode: "MGMT342",
    description: `This course initiative rests on the assumption that there is a powerful synergy between ‘sustainability’ and ‘innovation’ in business and society. The term ‘sustainable innovation’ refers to the creation of new market space, products and services or processes driven by social, environmental or sustainability concerns. Just like general innovation, sustainable innovation goes way beyond incremental improvements of products, services or processes. The challenge is to proactively embrace risk management and sustainability considerations (environmental, social, financial) aimed at aligning (novel) business strategies with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to create and capture new value. If managed well by results-oriented, socially aware sustainability leaders, sustainable innovation results not only in greater effectiveness at (intra)organisational levels but also helps to create a cleaner, healthier, fairer (and hopefully more stable) world as envisaged by the circular economy. The urgent need for sustainability has never been greater as evidenced by rapid population growth, pollution, (toxic) waste, plastic accumulating in our oceans, limited natural resources, climate change etc. This course will introduce students to the managerial discipline of innovation management with particular reference to examples of ‘good’ / ‘best’ sustainable innovation practices adopted by both local and international organisations such as City Development Limited (CDL), Banyan Tree, Sustainability Center Freiburg (launched in 2015 by the University of Freiburg in cooperation with five Fraunhofer research institutes), Henkel BeautyCare (whose Social Plastic Ecosystem in partnership with the Plastic Bank social enterprise is aimed at stopping ocean plastic and simultaneously providing opportunities for people in poverty), Procter & Gamble’s Tide Eco-Box (which contains less packaging, 60% less plastic and 30% less water than the current Tide press-tap) and many more.`,

Value co-creation is an integral performance outcome in digital platform ecosystems. In developing their digital strategies, leading companies in these systems increasingly aggregate and analyze data from both e-commerce activities and media content consumption to gain a multifaceted understanding of their customers, and to develop deep knowledge about media, entertainment, and e-commerce. As tech titans like Amazon, Netflix, Alibaba, Tencent, and Bytedance redefine the DMEEE landscape in Singapore and Southeast Asia, other ecosystem players including media firms, entertainment firms, manufacturers and retailers are presented with the challenge of developing their own digital strategies to thrive. This elective will introduce key concepts in strategic management in DMEEE and involve students in real-life strategic business challenges from Corporate Clients. Participants will have the opportunity to engage business leaders in project discussions.",

      "The course introduces Marketing as both a professional and an academic discipline. As a profession, marketers identify consumer needs, determine which target markets to serve, and develop an optimal product, pricing, promotion, and distribution strategy that best satisfy consumer needs, relative to competition. These decisions—product, price, promotion, and distribution—flow from a rigorous analysis of the constantly evolving market environment and consumer needs (for example, the recent rise of ethical, sustainable, and socially responsible consumption). Marketers serve a vital role in the long-term success of all organizations, profit-oriented as well as not-for-profit, small as well as large. Academically, marketing is a multi-disciplinary field involving the concepts, theories, and methods used to understand exchanges and long-term relationships between buyers and sellers. Through a combination of lectures, discussions, videos, individual and group assignments, and case analyses, the course is designed to cover the fundamental concepts and principles of this challenging field. It is a required course for marketing majors, which complements the theories and skills taught in many of the other majors at SMU.",

In most economies, services account for more than 50% of the economy. This course is designed for undergraduates seeking to develop a deeper understanding of services. Strategies used by successful services marketers to overcome problems unique to service industries like banking, health care, financial services, insurance, hospitality, consulting, telecom, media, and IT services will be discussed. Manufacturing and high tech industries which depend on services to provide added value will also be explored.`,

    This course builds upon the foundational principles acquired in MKTG101 by providing a more in-depth understanding of how different marketing concepts fit together. It also aims to develop students’ ability to develop a strategic plan, beginning with an analysis of situation, the selection of the right target segments and the right competitive advantages, to the formulation of a coherent set of marketing actions that contribute to the company’s goals. A problem-solving approach is taken in the course, with the view that an effective solution to a marketing problem requires a thorough understanding of the consumer/market and of the competitive context.

    This course is suitable not just for marketing majors, but anyone who has an understanding of basic marketing concepts and who wishes to have a good understanding of how strategic marketing can contribute to a company’s success.`,

While advertising, public relations, sales promotions and personal selling remain the essence of the promotions mix, the intention of this course is to show how these tools are integrated not just within the promotions mix but also beyond the other elements of the marketing mix. The popular mantra applies here: “all elements of the marketing mix have the capacity to communicate.” Major changes primarily impacted by the use of the digital media as well as the global impact of messaging in marketing needs to be strongly factored in today’s study of marketing communications. Ultimately, the end outcome of IMC is its impact on the brand in terms of its ability to elevate brand awareness, brand recognition and ultimately brand preference and loyalty. In all aspects of the topics covered in this course, the focus would be on the connection between marketing communications and branding and how IMC can help organizations build long-term brand equity.

    description:
      "Much of marketing in the last half century has been about the single-minded satisfaction of consumer needs and wants. The key to success is thought to lie in thoroughly understanding what these needs and wants are and ensuring the best fit between what is offered as a product and what is desired. This market-led approach, unfortunately, is myopic in its neglect of other stakeholders, such as the environment and the community. This course takes an alternative perspective, premised on climate change, deterioration of the marine ecosystem, and social inequalities as realities. It first examines how current consumption patterns are harming the environment and communities. It then delves into what responsible consumption entails and how consumers can be influenced to make product choices that are sustainable. Theories in psychology will be drawn on to provide that understanding of consumer behaviour. The course will also examine what companies can do to ensure that their marketing activities are aligned with sustainability goals. Case studies of companies with strong sustainability initiatives will be used to illuminate current best practices.",

The course provides an opportunity for the student to learn how compensation is structured and how the concept of “pay for performance” can work across different industries. The course includes methods of job evaluation for determining pay grades/scales, incentive-based pay approaches (including short- and long-term incentives, sales compensation and executive compensation), and international compensation. It also touches on performance management tools and implementation of performance management challenges in organizations.`,

Good decision making considers not only economic perspectives, but a broad spectrum of objectives to ensure decisions make ethical and business sense. This course focuses on familiarizing you with the foundations of descriptive and prescriptive (and less so, normative) aspects of decision making in individual, group, and organizational settings. Topics include information processing, heuristics and biases, decision frames, managerial risk perceptions, affective influences on decision making, intuition and expertise, ethical decision making, and group decision making.",

The context of the consulting process will be done with reference to the different HR domains and functions. This will help students to have a comprehensive understanding of the people (HR) challenges that organisations face and for which HR consulting may help resolve. As all consulting projects involve change of some form, the key principles of change management will also be explored. This course assumes some level of HR knowledge and practices. Hence, due to the nature of the content that will be covered, it is highly recommended that students take the Human Capital Management course prior to taking this HR Consulting course.",

    description: `The future of the HR profession lies in analytics. No professional entering the field can expect to succeed in his or her career without a solid understanding and hands-on practice of analytical tools to help in making people decisions. To implement their business strategies effectively, leaders must deal with people issues in a way that allows them to gain competitive advantage through people. The organizations that will win the “war for talent” will be those which are better at identifying and keeping key talent, motivating high performance, developing and promoting staff and predicting future people needs accurately. HR professionals need analytics to address these challenges. For exam-ple, linking pay-for-performance has been a dogma of management, but recent research shows that most incentive plans do not produce the desired behavior, and that pay, in fact, has little correlation to business results. To succeed in the business world, it is imperative that HR provide data-driven answers and insights on how to implement and execute strategy through the people in the organization. The course provides students with practi-cal, hands-on approaches to connect HR policies and practices to business performance. You will review key statis-tics and finance concepts, such as ROI and people productivity; become familiar with available tools such as Workday and Tableau to complement Excel and others; discuss data collection, clean-up and warehousing; prac-tice building descriptive and predictive models; and get hands-on experience in applications for workforce planning, recruitment, compensation, training, career planning and turnover. At the end of the semester, you will be able to put HR analytics skills and tools to good use.

It prepares students for enlightened management and suggests creative entrepreneurial opportunities. Outstanding service organizations are managed differently than their "merely good" competitors. Actions are based on totally different assumptions about the way success is achieved. The results show not only in terms of conventional measures of performance but also in the enthusiasm of the employees and quality of customer satisfaction. Beginning with the service encounter, service managers must blend marketing, technology, people, and information to achieve a distinctive competitive advantage. As the service sector is the fastest-growing sector of the economy, this course is also intended to help students discover entrepreneurial opportunities.`,

    description: `Transportation is an integral part of the global supply chain system. Goods cannot move on their own from supply points to demand locations, conferring transportation a central role in the global distribution of freight. Transportation creates value-add in a supply chain by performing the "moving" function in the physical distribution of products and it facilitates international trade and hence globalisation. In broader terms, transport connectivity is often referred to as the lifeline of a nation and is often a precondition for economic progress and development. This course explores the business issues in the design and operation of international transportation systems and underlines their strategic importance to firms and the economy. It draws upon the disciplines of operations management, decision analysis and transport economics to present a holistic view of the theories and practices of transportation management. The course also discusses the core concepts and terminologies of road, air, rail, sea and intermodal transportation, as well as the implications for contemporary supply chain management.`,

    description: `The objective of this course is to study how companies use their operations to improve environmental (and social) performance and contribute to business success at the same time. Many companies have started doing so by integrating sustainability into their operations. A focus on reducing environmental impact not only allows these companies to comply with increased regulations but also to reduce their costs, to improve the quality of their products, and to enhance the reputation of their brands. In addition, a new brand of companies is going beyond simply reducing negative externalities and actively tries to create a positive impact on the world. In this course, students will learn how citizens, governments, customers, and employees are creating pressures for more sustainable development and how operations managers are responding to these pressures with principles and frameworks such as waste reduction, pollution prevention, and product stewardship. Through the course, students will study specific tools and concepts such as life cycle assessment (LCA), design for environment (DfE), take-back legislation, green manufacturing, green purchasing, remanufacturing, recycling and by-product synergy. Students will also learn how to create a successful strategy for sustainable operations by incorporating sustainability considerations into business strategy, improvement planning, product and process design, supply management and risk management.`,

    description: `How did ZARA become one of the fastest growing and most profitable brands in fashion retailing? How did Wal-Mart grow to be the world's largest retailer? Largely the answer is that ZARA and Wal-Mart view their operational capabilities as an important and integral part of their competitive advantage. As do other successful companies, such as Procter & Gamble, Toyota, and Coca Cola, they invest strategically in physical plants and facilities, in process and information technology, in employees, suppliers, and distributor relationships, and perhaps most importantly, in organizational practices and know-how. The objective of this course is to provide students with a set of qualitative frameworks and quantitative tools to analyze and guide the long-term, strategic decisions for a company's operations function. This course caters to those interested in management and business consulting, general management, and operations careers. Finance specialists interested in assessing the risks, the opportunities, the competitive advantages, and ultimately the value embedded in a company’s operations will benefit from the course as well.`,

    description: `Matching supply with demand is a primary challenge for a firm: excess supply is too costly, inadequate supply irritates customers. Matching supply to demand is easiest when a firm has a flexible supply process, but flexibility is generally expensive. In this course we will learn (1) how to assess the appropriate level of supply flexibility for a given industry and (2) explore strategies for economically increasing a firm’s supply flexibility. Lastly we will study coordination and incentives across multiple firms in a supply chain. While tactical models and decisions are part of this course, the emphasis is on the qualitative insights needed by general managers or management consultants. We will demonstrate that companies can use (and have used) the principles from this course to significantly enhance their competitiveness.`,

    description: `Global Supply Chain refers to the cross-border organization of the activities required to produce goods or services and bring them to consumers through inputs and various phases of development, production and delivery (International Labour Organization). As global trade is dependent on global supply chain, companies make investment decisions to globalize, setting up production facilities overseas and sales offices beyond their domestic market. The key aspects for companies embarking on global Supply Chain involves cross-border sourcing, overseas production, global planning and international distribution, where the various components for a final product could be sourced from different parts of the world, and manufactured at one or multiple locations and have them distributed to different markets. Managing a global supply chain is also no longer about driving down cost, but it is how companies can maintain their competitiveness and global supply chains has never been more challenging and disruptive in the current environment of pandemic and geo-political tensions. In addition, e-commerce has also changed the design for global supply chain as well. This course provides students with a practical lens and frameworks regarding global supply chain. Students learn the key concepts on global supply chain management, together with special topics on maritime logistics, technology and green supply chain that affects the development of global supply chain. Understanding them would enable the students to better appreciate the complexities when handling global supply chain activities in future. Topics covered include: considerations for global sourcing, selection criteria for global production locations, planning in an uncertainty, volatility, complexity and ambiguity environment, various international methods of entry to overseas market, e-commerce distribution, incoterms and different modes of transportation, terms of payment, customs requirements, and maritime distribution network. Business cases and real-life examples will be used in the course. Industry speakers will be invited as guest lecturers to share the challenges and practical solutions relating to global supply chain. This course is highly relevant for the current business environment and is recommended for those interested in working for global companies managing cross-border business.`,

    description: `As much as 90% of world trade is carried via maritime transportation. A wide range of cargoes, each with their own specific handling and storage requirements, pass through the world's ports and terminals every day. Port operations is a complicated business dealing with a number of disparate activities such as the movement of ships, containers, and other cargo, the loading and unloading of ships and containers, and customs activities. Efficient port operations are important to ensure the smooth transition of cargoes, so that these cargoes reach their destination on time. This course introduces the functions of ports and their roles in contemporary logistics. With the intermodal advancements that lead to expanded but overlapping hinterlands, ports face competitive pressure. This course equips students with knowledge on port operations and how ports can provide value in the modern supply chain. The inter-related relationship among shipping lines, stevedores, port operators and the regulatory environment is discussed.`,

This course addresses the sustainability imperative for shipping and ports and the various solutions that are available to the different industry stakeholders. Indeed, the shipping and ports industries have started to respond to the growing environmental and social concerns of regulators, customers and the local communities in which they operate, while at the same time increasingly recognizing that sustainability may provide for new business opportunities and profitability.`,

Does the media foster understanding, insight, and hold the powerful to account, or does it spread discord, misinformation, and maintain power hierarchies? These are the kinds of questions that students can find answers to in this project-based research design course. During the course students will learn how to write a rigorous empirical research paper and develop the methodological skills to survey public opinion and systematically code media content. After studying how to plan a content analysis and public opinion survey, students will work in groups and write a research proposal on a topic of their choosing. Potential topics are wide ranging. For instance, they could relate to elections, identity politics, migration, protest, conflict, as well as economic, business, environmental, health, or educational issues. Students then choose to design a survey or a content analysis. For the survey, students develop a questionnaire plan to gather public opinions on the media or preform a survey experiment to understand the impact of media. Students doing a content analysis will develop a codebook to code newspapers, TV, film, social media, or the web. After analyzing their unique data, student projects culminate in a presentation and an original research paper of approximately 9,000 words.`,

We will survey the history of political thinking in Europe, mainly because a global capitalist economy and the dissemination of the modern state form in the postwar period beyond Europe makes the political and social categories articulated in the Western tradition applicable to non-European contexts. Each week, we will concentrate on primary texts by canonical thinkers ranging from Plato to Foucault. In discussing the works of individual political philosophers, our objective is not to study each thinker's thought for its own sake but to investigate the fundamental concepts and questions they brought to the fore. We will regularly ground the abstract ideas we examine in empirical phenomena, both past and present. This enterprise will involve textual interpretation and critical reflection in order to systematically scrutinize what we mean by “politics,” where we draw the boundaries of the “political,” and how we interrelate different political concepts and schemes.`,

    description: `This course critically analyses public policy designs and how governments pursue the process of designing. With an overarching focus on contemporary environmental sustainability topics, the course allows students to explore questions about how different categories of policy instruments or tools that are part of governments' public policy 'toolkits' are formulated, how they work and how they can be combined in order to address multifaceted problems of the environment. The course allows an examination the craft of policy design from a policy process perspective, namely: how public policy problems get framed and raised on government agendas, how different instruments are analysed, combined and chosen as solutions to these problems, how these instruments mixes are implemented and how their success at addressing policy goals gets evaluated. Students of the course will have the opportunity to analyse contemporary environmental policy cases and learn about the policy design experience from experts of the field who will be invited as guest speakers to the classroom. Some topics that are covered in the course include: policy cycles; policy tool classifications; simple vs. complex tool mixes; policy instrument calibrations; procedural instruments; nudges and nodality tools; regulations and authority-based instruments; organizational tools and tools for co-production and collaborative government.`,

To understand how people make choices or decisions, we need to understand the thinking, reasoning and judgment processes involved. In addition, decision and choice situations often involve making tradeoffs (e.g. price versus quality) or evaluating multiple different options and alternatives. With limited human cognitive capacity and the multiple task demands involved in choice and decision making, it appears that reasoning or decision-making processes are challenging. This course will help you understand these complexities and processes. It will cover topics such as judgments of risk and uncertainty, affect and decision making, self-control, heuristics and biases. In addition, we will connect decision-making theories to other areas of application, such as negotiation, consumer behaviour, and team processes.`,

This promotes the pursuit of passive and convenient leisure in contrast to their more goal-directed and effortful work activities. Unfortunately, research shows that passive leisure is not restorative nor provides important ingredients to meaningful living. In this course, we examine people’s motivation to work and its reciprocal relationship with their pursuit of leisure. It aims to help students apply to their daily lives what the psychological literature advocates about quality leisure activities and living a "good" life, which will also help them flourish at work.`,

    The concept that created the subject and led to the development of the field of financial derivatives is the work of Fisher Black and Myron Scholes (1973). Stochastic models based on the principle of no-arbitrage, dynamic hedging, martingale valuation, and risk-neutrality can be formulated to price derivatives traded in the financial market. The same framework has subsequently been applied to the pricing and hedging of other more exotic financial products.
    The course is an interesting mix of finance and mathematics. Students will see that fundamental financial concepts like the no-arbitrage principle, coupled with careful mathematical reasoning, lead to a sophisticated framework of valuation and hedging.
    The mathematical tools employed are calculus, stochastic calculus, probability theory and numerical methods. A good background in calculus and probability is assumed. The other mathematical requisites will be furnished during the course.`,

The first part of the course is devoted to introducing students to key theoretical perspectives in environmental sociology. Environmental sociology examines the changing relationship between social systems and the environment and explores how environmental issues emerge—and can be addressed—as social problems. In the second part, we take these theoretical perspectives to investigate the food system. We explore how society and environment interacts throughout the food system, how the current food system faces challenges in sustainability, and how sustainable alternatives can be developed.`,

It plays a decisive role in socializing younger generations, stratifying them to different socioeconomic statuses, and producing new visions, knowledge, and technologies for society. Given its connections with the economy, politics, family, and other spheres of social life, however, the education system is also penetrated by multiple societal problems and contradictions. In this course, we will examine these problems and contradictions, simultaneously internal and external to the education system, while critically reflecting on our own experiences as stakeholders in the system.`,

In the first half of the course, students work in SMU teams to communicate their recommendations persuasively through corporate documents like executive summaries and Slidedocs. Through whole-class and small-group discussions, students explore theories on virtual communication and working in remote teams, and familiarize themselves with tools for cultural analysis and virtual collaboration. In the culminating capstone project in collaboration with the University of Southern California (USC), students will work in global teams comprising students from universities across Asia, Europe and America to develop a proposal for a corporate client. Past industry partners of the VBP project included companies such as Google, Starbucks, Netflix, Tesla and SpaceX. Over 6 weeks, students collaborate virtually with their global counterparts to craft a report to the client of their choice, recommending strategies to enhance the client’s corporate reputation. In the course of the project, students use social and AI-driven collaboration tools, navigate cross-cultural team processes and learn to collaborate effectively across borders and time zones. The deliverables in this course can be included in students’ portfolio of written and reflective work to showcase their ability to produce industry and discipline-specific communication outcomes. USC will award certificates of achievement to all participants.`,

While the Writing & Reasoning course, taken by most SMU students in their first year, focuses on breadth, here the students will be deepening their skills by exploring and writing about more complex issues in society and business. Students will engage with the need for deeper research, better audience analysis, and more structured writing, with a more nuanced adaptation to the context appropriate to their intended publications. Students will consider and respond to meaningful real-world issues and situations in each of the three written projects. They will explore not only what other people have said about the issues that they confront, but also develop and communicate their own responses. The finished pieces will form the basis of a portfolio of written work to showcase their ability to think critically, conduct appropriate literature research, analyse their findings, argue their case, and produce professional communication outcomes. This portfolio will be a valuable addition to their resumes when they graduate. The final project will be an in-depth feature piece written for either Rice Media (https://www.ricemedia.co/) or the Skeptic Magazine (https://www.skeptic.org.uk/). Rice Media, and Skeptic Magazine editors advise the students during the Week 10 presentations, and students will have the chance to have their work published by the media outlet that they write for after the term finishes.`,

Additionally, arts organisations can no longer rely on pre-pandemic business models to sustain their survival, relevance and influence. Navigating these new challenges with a commitment to creative entrepreneurship and community relevance will be critical moving forward. This special topic on Arts Entrepreneurship and Creative Economies was chosen because the arts today must be equipped to deal with the radical socio-economic and environmental changes that we are living through, from evolving audience behaviours to the relentless pressures of inflation and a boundless array of inequities. Additionally, arts organisations can no longer rely on pre-pandemic business models to sustain their survival, relevance and influence. Navigating these new challenges with a commitment to creative entrepreneurship, community relevance and social justice will be critical moving forward. This topic will focus on enabling students to adopt an entrepreneurial mindset to identify, frame and shape the developments, challenges and opportunities facing the cultural and creative industries today and in the near future. They will acquire conceptual and practical skills to address these challenges using a cultural economics approach and cultural value perspective, particularly within a Singapore context. Upon completion, students will better understand: (1) the dynamic development and competition of the arts as exceptional and creative economies in Singapore, (2) the ambidexterity required to support the creation of conducive conditions to develop works of art, creative goods and services, and (3) how to develop evidence-based insights and value-based strategies from existing empirical case studies and ventures. **This course will require preexisting arts management and Singapore art world knowledge.`,

    description: `Across the globe, the arts and culture have been identified as key instruments for urban rejuvenation and global competitiveness. Asia is no exception – over the last twenty years, there has been a proliferation of large-scale arts and cultural infrastructure, as well as an energetic bubbling of artist-led initiatives in cities such as Singapore, Jakarta, Hong Kong and Seoul.

    This course aims to explore the growing and diversified roles of “arts” and “culture” in contemporary urbanism, and to interrogate how categories such as “arts” and “culture” can transform cities. In particular, this course will focus on the changing spatial conditions and challenges of the arts and culture in Asia, with a focus on the role of Singapore in the region during this time of rapid change, global complexity and increasing austerity.

    Through an analysis of a range of real-world case studies and experiential learning, students will critically consider questions such as: What are the roles of arts and culture in cities today? Can the arts and culture become key drivers of urban growth, enabling cities to forge and maintain global connections? Do they differentiate cities, and generate distinctive place-identities amidst a globalising world? How do art events and exhibitions like biennales influence cultural and city development, and give rise to more diverse, reflective and vibrant societies? Can the arts and culture create, reinforce and enhance sense of place and belonging in global cities, especially for the less privileged? What are some of the particularities and specificities of the arts within cities in the Asia-Pacific region?

    Ultimately, this course aspires to provide students with a reflexive understanding of the unique arts ecologies in Asia, and a heightened appreciation of the significance of the arts to urban processes, practices and everyday life.`,
